Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To the Public:
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The flattering reception that has been given, by the public, to Arthur
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Mervyn, has prompted the writer to solicit a continuance of the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,favour, and to offer to the world a new performance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,America has opened new views to the naturalist and politician, but has
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seldom furnished themes to the moral painter. That new springs of action
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and new motives to curiosity should operate,--that the field of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,investigation, opened to us by our own country, should differ
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,essentially from those which exist in Europe,--may be readily conceived.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sources of amusement to the fancy and instruction to the heart, that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,are peculiar to ourselves, are equally numerous and inexhaustible. It is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the purpose of this work to profit by some of these sources; to exhibit
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a series of adventures, growing out of the condition of our country, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,connected with one of the most common and most wonderful diseases or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,affections of the human frame.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,One merit the writer may at least claim:--that of calling forth the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passions and engaging the sympathy of the reader by means hitherto
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unemployed by preceding authors. Puerile superstition and exploded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,manners, Gothic castles and chimeras, are the materials usually employed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for this end. The incidents of Indian hostility, and the perils of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Western wilderness, are far more suitable; and for a native of America
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to overlook these would admit of no apology. These, therefore, are, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,part, the ingredients of this tale, and these he has been ambitious of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depicting in vivid and faithful colours. The success of his efforts must
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be estimated by the liberal and candid reader.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I sit down, my friend, to comply with thy request. At length does the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impetuosity of my fears, the transports of my wonder, permit me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recollect my promise and perform it. At length am I somewhat delivered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from suspense and from tremors. At length the drama is brought to an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imperfect close, and the series of events that absorbed my faculties,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that hurried away my attention, has terminated in repose.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Till now, to hold a steadfast pen was impossible; to disengage my senses
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the scene that was passing or approaching; to forbear to grasp at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,futurity; to suffer so much thought to wander from the purpose which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,engrossed my fears and my hopes, could not be.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Yet am I sure that even now my perturbations are sufficiently stilled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for an employment like this? That the incidents I am going to relate can
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be recalled and arranged without indistinctness and confusion? That
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,emotions will not be reawakened by my narrative, incompatible with order
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and coherence? Yet when I shall be better qualified for this task I know
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not. Time may take away these headlong energies, and give me back my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ancient sobriety; but this change will only be effected by weakening my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remembrance of these events. In proportion as I gain power over words,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shall I lose dominion over sentiments. In proportion as my tale is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deliberate and slow, the incidents and motives which it is designed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exhibit will be imperfectly revived and obscurely portrayed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Oh, why art thou away at a time like this. Wert thou present, the office
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to which my pen is so inadequate would easily be executed by my tongue.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Accents can scarcely be too rapid; or that which words should fail to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,convey, my looks and gestures would suffice to communicate. But I know
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thy coming is impossible. To leave this spot is equally beyond my power.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To keep thee in ignorance of what has happened would justly offend thee.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There is no method of informing thee except by letter, and this method
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,must I, therefore, adopt.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How short is the period that has elapsed since thou and I parted, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,yet how full of tumult and dismay has been my soul during that period!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What light has burst upon my ignorance of myself and of mankind! How
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sudden and enormous the transition from uncertainty to knowledge!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But let me recall my thoughts; let me struggle for so much composure as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,will permit my pen to trace intelligible characters. Let me place in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,order the incidents that are to compose my tale. I need not call on thee
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to listen. The fate of Waldegrave was as fertile of torment to thee as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to me. His bloody and mysterious catastrophe equally awakened thy grief,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thy revenge, and thy curiosity. Thou wilt catch from my story every
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,horror and every sympathy which it paints. Thou wilt shudder with my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,foreboding and dissolve with my tears. As the sister of my friend, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as one who honours me with her affection, thou wilt share in all my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tasks and all my dangers.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You need not be reminded with what reluctance I left you. To reach this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,place by evening was impossible, unless I had set out early in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,morning; but your society was too precious not to be enjoyed to the last
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moment. It was indispensable to be here on Tuesday, but my duty required
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no more than that I should arrive by sunrise on that day. To travel
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,during the night was productive of no formidable inconvenience. The air
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was likely to be frosty and sharp, but these would not incommode one who
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,walked with speed. A nocturnal journey in districts so romantic and wild
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as these, through which lay my road, was more congenial to my temper
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,than a noonday ramble.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,By nightfall I was within ten miles of my uncle's house. As the darkness
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,increased, and I advanced on my way, my sensations sunk into melancholy.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The scene and the time reminded me of the friend whom I had lost. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recalled his features, and accents, and gestures, and mused with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unutterable feelings on the circumstances of his death.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My recollections once more plunged me into anguish and perplexity. Once
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more I asked, Who was his assassin? By what motives could he be impelled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to a deed like this? Waldegrave was pure from all offence. His piety was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rapturous. His benevolence was a stranger to remissness or torpor. All
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who came within the sphere of his influence experienced and acknowledged
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his benign activity. His friends were few, because his habits were timid
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and reserved; but the existence of an enemy was impossible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I recalled the incidents of our last interview, my importunities that he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should postpone his ill-omened journey till the morning, his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inexplicable obstinacy, his resolution to set out on foot during a dark
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and tempestuous night, and the horrible disaster that befell him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The first intimation I received of this misfortune, the insanity of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vengeance and grief into which I was hurried, my fruitless searches for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the author of this guilt, my midnight wanderings and reveries beneath
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the shade of that fatal elm, were revived and reacted. I heard the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discharge of the pistol, I witnessed the alarm of Inglefield, I heard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his calls to his servants, and saw them issue forth with lights and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hasten to the spot whence the sound had seemed to proceed. I beheld my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friend, stretched upon the earth, ghastly with a mortal wound, alone,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with no traces of the slayer visible, no tokens by which his place of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,refuge might be sought, the motives of his enmity or his instruments of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mischief might be detected.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I hung over the dying youth, whose insensibility forbade him to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recognise his friend, or unfold the cause of his destruction. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accompanied his remains to the grave; I tended the sacred spot where he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lay; I once more exercised my penetration and my zeal in pursuit of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assassin. Once more my meditations and exertions were doomed to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappointed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I need not remind thee of what is past. Time and reason seemed to have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dissolved the spell which made me deaf to the dictates of duty and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discretion. Remembrances had ceased to agonize, to urge me to headlong
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acts and foster sanguinary purposes. The gloom was half dispersed, and a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,radiance had succeeded sweeter than my former joys.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Now, by some unseen concurrence of reflections, my thoughts reverted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into some degree of bitterness. Methought that to ascertain the hand who
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,killed my friend was not impossible, and to punish the crime was just.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That to forbear inquiry or withhold punishment was to violate my duty to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my God and to mankind. The impulse was gradually awakened that bade me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,once more to seek the elm; once more to explore the ground; to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scrutinize its trunk. What could I expect to find? Had it not been a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hundred times examined? Had I not extended my search to the neighbouring
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,groves and precipices? Had I not pored upon the brooks, and pried into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the pits and hollows, that were adjacent to the scene of blood?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Lately I had viewed this conduct with shame and regret; but in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,present state of my mind it assumed the appearance of conformity with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prudence, and I felt myself irresistibly prompted to repeat my search.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some time had elapsed since my departure from this district,--time
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enough for momentous changes to occur. Expedients that formerly were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,useless might now lead instantaneously to the end which I sought. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tree which had formerly been shunned by the criminal might, in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,absence of the avenger of blood, be incautiously approached. Thoughtless
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or fearless of my return, it was possible that he might, at this moment,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be detected hovering near the scene of his offences.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Nothing can be pleaded in extenuation of this relapse into folly. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,return, after an absence of some duration, into the scene of these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,transactions and sufferings, the time of night, the glimmering of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stars, the obscurity in which external objects were wrapped, and which,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequently, did not draw my attention from the images of fancy, may in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some degree account for the revival of those sentiments and resolutions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which immediately succeeded the death of Waldegrave, and which, during
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my visit to you, had been suspended.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You know the situation of the elm, in the midst of a private road, on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the verge of Norwalk, near the habitation of Inglefield, but three miles
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from my uncle's house. It was now my intention to visit it. The road in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I was travelling led a different way. It was requisite to leave
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it, therefore, and make a circuit through meadows and over steeps. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,journey would, by these means, be considerably prolonged; but on that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,head I was indifferent, or rather, considering how far the night had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,already advanced, it was desirable not to reach home till the dawn.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I proceeded in this new direction with speed. Time, however, was allowed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for my impetuosities to subside, and for sober thoughts to take place.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Still I persisted in this path. To linger a few moments in this shade,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to ponder on objects connected with events so momentous to my happiness,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,promised me a mournful satisfaction. I was familiar with the way, though
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trackless and intricate, and I climbed the steeps, crept through the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brambles, leaped the rivulets and fences with undeviating aim, till at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length I reached the craggy and obscure path which led to Inglefield's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,house.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In a short time, I descried through the dusk the widespread branches of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the elm. This tree, however faintly seen, cannot be mistaken for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,another. The remarkable bulk and shape of its trunk, its position in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,midst of the way, its branches spreading into an ample circumference,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made it conspicuous from afar. My pulse throbbed as I approached it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My eyes were eagerly bent to discover the trunk and the area beneath the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shade. These, as I approached, gradually became visible. The trunk was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not the only thing which appeared in view. Somewhat else, which made
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,itself distinguishable by its motions, was likewise noted. I faltered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and stopped.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To a casual observer this appearance would have been unnoticed. To me,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it could not but possess a powerful significance. All my surmises and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspicions instantly returned. This apparition was human, it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,connected with the fate of Waldegrave, it led to a disclosure of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,author of that fate. What was I to do? To approach unwarily would alarm
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the person. Instant flight would set him beyond discovery and reach.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I walked softly to the roadside. The ground was covered with rocky
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,masses, scattered among shrub-oaks and dwarf-cedars, emblems of its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sterile and uncultivated state. Among these it was possible to elude
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,observation and yet approach near enough to gain an accurate view of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this being.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At this time, the atmosphere was somewhat illuminated by the moon,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which, though it had already set, was yet so near the horizon as to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benefit me by its light. The shape of a man, tall and robust, was now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinguished. Repeated and closer scrutiny enabled me to perceive that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he was employed in digging the earth. Something like flannel was wrapped
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,round his waist and covered his lower limbs. The rest of his frame was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,naked. I did not recognise in him any one whom I knew.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A figure, robust and strange, and half naked, to be thus employed, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this hour and place, was calculated to rouse up my whole soul. His
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occupation was mysterious and obscure. Was it a grave that he was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,digging? Was his purpose to explore or to hide? Was it proper to watch
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him at a distance, unobserved and in silence, or to rush upon him and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extort from him, by violence or menaces, an explanation of the scene?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Before my resolution was formed, he ceased to dig. He cast aside his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spade and sat down in the pit that he had dug. He seemed wrapped in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,meditation; but the pause was short, and succeeded by sobs, at first low
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and at wide intervals, but presently louder and more vehement. Sorely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,charged was indeed that heart whence flowed these tokens of sorrow.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Never did I witness a scene of such mighty anguish, such heart-bursting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grief.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What should I think? I was suspended in astonishment. Every sentiment,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at length, yielded to my sympathy. Every new accent of the mourner
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,struck upon my heart with additional force, and tears found their way
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spontaneously to my eyes. I left the spot where I stood, and advanced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,within the verge of the shade. My caution had forsaken me, and, instead
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of one whom it was duty to persecute, I beheld, in this man, nothing but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an object of compassion.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My pace was checked by his suddenly ceasing to lament. He snatched the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spade, and, rising on his feet, began to cover up the pit with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,utmost diligence. He seemed aware of my presence, and desirous of hiding
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,something from my inspection. I was prompted to advance nearer and hold
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his hand, but my uncertainty as to his character and views, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,abruptness with which I had been ushered into this scene, made me still
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hesitate; but, though I hesitated to advance, there was nothing to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hinder me from calling.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What, ho!" said I. "Who is there? What are you doing?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He stopped: the spade fell from his hand; he looked up and bent forward
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his face towards the spot where I stood. An interview and explanation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were now, methought, unavoidable. I mustered up my courage to confront
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and interrogate this being.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He continued for a minute in his gazing and listening attitude. Where I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stood I could not fail of being seen, and yet he acted as if he saw
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing. Again he betook himself to his spade, and proceeded with new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,diligence to fill up the pit. This demeanour confounded and bewildered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me. I had no power but to stand and silently gaze upon his motions.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The pit being filled, he once more sat upon the ground, and resigned
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,himself to weeping and sighs with more vehemence than before. In a short
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time the fit seemed to have passed. He rose, seized the spade, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,advanced to the spot where I stood.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Again I made preparation as for an interview which could not but take
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,place. He passed me, however, without appearing to notice my existence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He came so near as almost to brush my arm, yet turned not his head to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,either side. My nearer view of him made his brawny arms and lofty
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stature more conspicuous; but his imperfect dress, the dimness of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,light, and the confusion of my own thoughts, hindered me from discerning
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his features. He proceeded with a few quick steps along the road, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,presently darted to one side and disappeared among the rocks and bushes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My eye followed him as long as he was visible, but my feet were rooted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the spot. My musing was rapid and incongruous. It could not fail to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,terminate in one conjecture, that this person was _asleep_. Such
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instances were not unknown to me, through the medium of conversation and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,books. Never, indeed, had it fallen under my own observation till now,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and now it was conspicuous, and environed with all that could give edge
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to suspicion and vigour to inquiry. To stand here was no longer of use,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and I turned my steps towards my uncle's habitation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter II.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had food enough for the longest contemplation. My steps partook, as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,usual, of the vehemence of my thoughts, and I reached my uncle's gate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before I believed myself to have lost sight of the elm. I looked up and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovered the well-known habitation. I could not endure that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reflections should so speedily be interrupted. I therefore passed the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gate, and stopped not till I had reached a neighbouring summit, crowned
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with chestnut-oaks and poplars.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Here I more deliberately reviewed the incidents that had just occurred.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The inference was just, that the man, half clothed and digging, was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sleeper; but what was the cause of this morbid activity? What was the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mournful vision that dissolved him in tears, and extorted from him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tokens of inconsolable distress? What did he seek, or what endeavour to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conceal, in this fatal spot? The incapacity of sound sleep denotes a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mind sorely wounded. It is thus that atrocious criminals denote the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possession of some dreadful secret. The thoughts, which considerations
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of safety enable them to suppress or disguise during wakefulness,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,operate without impediment, and exhibit their genuine effects, when the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,notices of sense are partly excluded and they are shut out from a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowledge of their entire condition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This is the perpetrator of some nefarious deed. What but the murder of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Waldegrave could direct his steps hither? His employment was part of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some fantastic drama in which his mind was busy. To comprehend it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,demands penetration into the recesses of his soul. But one thing is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sure: an incoherent conception of his concern in that transaction
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bewitches him hither. This it is that deluges his heart with bitterness
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and supplies him with ever-flowing tears.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But whence comes he? He does not start from the bosom of the earth, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hide himself in airy distance. He must have a name and a terrestrial
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,habitation. It cannot be at an immeasurable distance from the haunted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,elm. Inglefield's house is the nearest. This may be one of its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inhabitants. I did not recognise his features, but this was owing to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dusky atmosphere and to the singularity of his garb. Inglefield has two
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,servants, one of whom was a native of this district, simple, guileless,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and incapable of any act of violence. He was, moreover, devoutly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attached to his sect. He could not be the criminal.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The other was a person of a very different cast. He was an emigrant from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Ireland, and had been six months in the family of my friend. He was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pattern of sobriety and gentleness. His mind was superior to his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,situation. His natural endowments were strong, and had enjoyed all the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,advantage of cultivation. His demeanour was grave, and thoughtful, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compassionate. He appeared not untinctured with religion; but his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,devotion, though unostentatious, was of a melancholy tenor.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was nothing in the first view of his character calculated to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,engender suspicion. The neighbourhood was populous. But, as I conned
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,over the catalogue, I perceived that the only foreigner among us was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero. Our scheme was, for the most part, a patriarchal one. Each
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,farmer was surrounded by his sons and kinsmen. This was an exception to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the rule. Clithero was a stranger, whose adventures and character,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,previously to his coming hither, were unknown to us. The elm was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surrounded by his master's domains. An actor there must be, and no one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was equally questionable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The more I revolved the pensive and reserved deportment of this man, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ignorance in which we were placed respecting his former situation, his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible motives for abandoning his country and choosing a station so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,much below the standard of his intellectual attainments, the stronger my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspicions became. Formerly, when occupied with conjectures relative to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the same topic, the image of this man did not fail to occur; but the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seeming harmlessness of his ordinary conduct had raised him to a level
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with others, and placed him equally beyond the reach of suspicion. I did
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not, till now, advert to the recentness of his appearance among us, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the obscurity that hung over his origin and past life. But now these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,considerations appeared so highly momentous as almost to decide the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,question of his guilt.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But how were these doubts to be changed into absolute certainty?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Henceforth this man was to become the subject of my scrutiny. I was to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gain all the knowledge, respecting him, which those with whom he lived,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and were the perpetual witnesses of his actions, could impart. For this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,end I was to make minute inquiries, and to put seasonable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interrogatories. From this conduct I promised myself an ultimate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solution of my doubts.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I acquiesced in this view of things with considerable satisfaction. It
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seemed as if the maze was no longer inscrutable. It would be quickly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovered who were the agents and instigators of the murder of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friend.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But it suddenly occurred to me, For what purpose shall I prosecute this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,search? What benefit am I to reap from this discovery? How shall I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,demean myself when the criminal is detected? I was not insensible, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that moment, of the impulses of vengeance, but they were transient. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,detested the sanguinary resolutions that I had once formed. Yet I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fearful of the effects of my hasty rage, and dreaded an encounter in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequence of which I might rush into evils which no time could repair,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nor penitence expiate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"But why," said I, "should it be impossible to arm myself with firmness?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,If forbearance be the dictate of wisdom, cannot it be so deeply engraven
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on my mind as to defy all temptation, and be proof against the most
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,abrupt surprise? My late experience has been of use to me. It has shown
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me my weakness and my strength. Having found my ancient fortifications
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,insufficient to withstand the enemy, what should I learn from thence but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that it becomes me to strengthen and enlarge them?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"No caution, indeed, can hinder the experiment from being hazardous. Is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it wise to undertake experiments by which nothing can be gained, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,much may be lost? Curiosity is vicious, if undisciplined by reason, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inconducive to benefit."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was not, however, to be diverted from my purpose. Curiosity, like
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,virtue, is its own reward. Knowledge is of value for its own sake, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pleasure is annexed to the acquisition, without regard to any thing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beyond. It is precious even when disconnected with moral inducements and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heartfelt sympathies; but the knowledge which I sought by its union with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these was calculated to excite the most complex and fiery sentiments in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my bosom.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Hours were employed in revolving these thoughts. At length I began to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sensible of fatigue, and, returning home, explored the way to my chamber
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without molesting the repose of the family. You know that our doors are
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,always unfastened, and are accessible at all hours of the night.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My slumbers were imperfect, and I rejoiced when the morning light
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,permitted me to resume my meditations. The day glided away, I scarcely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,know how, and, as I had rejoiced at the return of morning, I now hailed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with pleasure, the approach of night.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My uncle and sisters having retired, I betook myself, instead of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,following their example, to the _Chestnut-hill_. Concealed among
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,its rocks, or gazing at the prospect which stretched so far and so wide
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,around it, my fancy has always been accustomed to derive its highest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enjoyment from this spot. I found myself again at leisure to recall the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scene which I had witnessed during the last night, to imagine its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,connection with the fate of Waldegrave, and to plan the means of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovering the secret that was hidden under these appearances.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Shortly, I began to feel insupportable disquiet at the thoughts of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,postponing this discovery. Wiles and stratagems were practicable, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they were tedious, and of dubious success. Why should I proceed like a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plotter? Do I intend the injury of this person? A generous purpose will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surely excuse me from descending to artifices. There are two modes of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,drawing forth the secrets of another,--by open and direct means and by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circuitous and indirect. Why scruple to adopt the former mode? Why not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,demand a conference, and state my doubts, and demand a solution of them,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in a manner worthy of a beneficent purpose? Why not hasten to the spot?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He may be, at this moment, mysteriously occupied under this shade. I may
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,note his behaviour; I may ascertain his person, if not by the features
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that belong to him, yet by tracing his footsteps when he departs, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pursuing him to his retreats.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I embraced this scheme, which was thus suggested, with eagerness. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,threw myself with headlong speed down the hill and pursued my way to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,elm. As I approached the tree, my palpitations increased, though my pace
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,slackened. I looked forward with an anxious glance. The trunk of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tree was hidden in the deepest shade. I advanced close up to it. No one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was visible, but I was not discouraged. The hour of his coming was,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perhaps, not arrived. I took my station at a small distance, beside a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fence, on the right hand.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,An hour elapsed before my eyes lighted on the object of which they were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in search. My previous observation had been roving from one quarter to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,another. At last, it dwelt upon the tree. The person whom I before
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,described was seated on the ground. I had not perceived him before, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the means by which he placed himself in this situation had escaped my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,notice. He seemed like one whom an effort of will, without the exercise
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of locomotion, had transported hither, or made visible. His state of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disarray, and the darkness that shrouded him, prevented me, as before,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from distinguishing any peculiarities in his figure or countenance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I continued watchful and mute. The appearances already described took
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,place on this occasion, except the circumstance of digging in the earth.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He sat musing for a while, then burst into sighs and lamentations.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These being exhausted, he rose to depart. He stalked away with a solemn
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and deliberate pace. I resolved to tread, as closely as possible, in his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,footsteps, and not to lose sight of him till the termination of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,career.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Contrary to my expectation, he went in a direction opposite to that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which led to Inglefield's. Presently, he stopped at bars, which he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cautiously removed, and, when he had passed through them, as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deliberately replaced. He then proceeded along an obscure path, which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,led across stubble-fields, to a wood. The path continued through the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wood, but he quickly struck out of it, and made his way, seemingly at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,random, through a most perplexing undergrowth of bushes and briers.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was, at first, fearful that the noise which I made behind him, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trampling down the thicket, would alarm him; but he regarded it not. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,way that he had selected was always difficult: sometimes considerable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,force was requisite to beat down obstacles; sometimes it led into a deep
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,glen, the sides of which were so steep as scarcely to afford a footing;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sometimes into fens, from which some exertions were necessary to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extricate the feet, and sometimes through rivulets, of which the water
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rose to the middle.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,For some time I felt no abatement of my speed or my resolution. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thought I might proceed, without fear, through brakes and dells which my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guide was able to penetrate. He was perpetually changing his direction.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I could form no just opinion as to my situation or distance from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,place at which we had set out.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I began at length to be weary. A suspicion, likewise, suggested itself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to my mind, whether my guide did not perceive that he was followed, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thus prolonged his journey in order to fatigue or elude his pursuer. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was determined, however, to baffle his design. Though the air was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,frosty, my limbs were bedewed with sweat and my joints were relaxed with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,toil, but I was obstinately bent upon proceeding.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At length a new idea occurred to me. On finding me indefatigable in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pursuit, this person might resort to more atrocious methods of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,concealment. But what had I to fear? It was sufficient to be upon my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guard. Man to man, I needed not to dread his encounter.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,We at last arrived at the verge of a considerable precipice. He kept
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,along the edge. From this height, a dreary vale was discoverable,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,embarrassed with the leafless stocks of bushes, and encumbered with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rugged and pointed rocks. This scene reminded me of my situation. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desert tract called Norwalk, which I have often mentioned to you, my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,curiosity had formerly induced me to traverse in various directions. It
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was in the highest degree rugged, picturesque, and wild. This vale,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,though I had never before viewed it by the glimpses of the moon,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggested the belief that I had visited it before. Such a one I knew
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,belonged to this uncultivated region. If this opinion were true, we were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at no inconsiderable distance from Inglefield's habitation. "Where,"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,said I, "is this singular career to terminate?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Though occupied with these reflections, I did not slacken my pursuit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The stranger kept along the verge of the cliff, which gradually declined
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,till it terminated in the valley. He then plunged into its deepest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thickets. In a quarter of an hour he stopped under a projecture of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rock which formed the opposite side of the vale. He then proceeded to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remove the stalks, which, as I immediately perceived, concealed the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mouth of a cavern. He plunged into the darkness, and in a few moments
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his steps were heard no more.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Hitherto my courage had supported me, but here it failed. Was this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,person an assassin, who was acquainted with the windings of the grotto,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and who would take advantage of the dark to execute his vengeance upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me, who had dared to pursue him to these forlorn retreats? or was he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maniac, or walker in his sleep? Whichever supposition were true, it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would be rash in me to follow him. Besides, he could not long remain in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these darksome recesses, unless some fatal accident should overtake him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I seated myself at the mouth of the cave, determined patiently to wait
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,till he should think proper to emerge. This opportunity of rest was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exceedingly acceptable after so toilsome a pilgrimage. My pulse began to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beat more slowly, and the moisture that incommoded me ceased to flow.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The coolness, which for a little time was delicious, presently increased
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to shivering, and I found it necessary to change my posture, in order to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,preserve my blood from congealing.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,After I had formed a path before the cavern's mouth, by the removal of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obstructions, I employed myself in walking to and fro. In this situation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I saw the moon gradually decline to the horizon, and, at length,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappear. I marked the deepenings of the shade, and the mutations which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,every object successively underwent. The vale was narrow, and hemmed in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on all sides by lofty and precipitous cliffs. The gloom deepened as the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moon declined, and the faintness of starlight was all that preserved my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,senses from being useless to my own guidance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I drew nearer the cleft at which this mysterious personage had entered.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I stretched my hands before it, determined that he should not emerge
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from his den without my notice. His steps would, necessarily,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,communicate the tidings of his approach. He could not move without a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,noise which would be echoed to, on all sides, by the abruptness by which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this valley was surrounded. Here, then, I continued till the day began
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to dawn, in momentary expectation of the stranger's reappearance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My attention was at length excited by a sound that seemed to issue from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cave. I imagined that the sleeper was returning, and prepared
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,therefore to seize him. I blamed myself for neglecting the opportunities
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that had already been afforded, and was determined that another should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not escape. My eyes were fixed upon the entrance. The rustling
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,increased, and presently an animal leaped forth, of what kind I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unable to discover. Heart-struck by this disappointment, but not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discouraged, I continued to watch, but in vain. The day was advancing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,apace. At length the sun arose, and its beams glistened on the edges of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cliffs above, whose sapless stalks and rugged masses were covered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with hoarfrost. I began to despair of success, but was unwilling to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depart until it was no longer possible to hope for the return of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extraordinary personage. Whether he had been swallowed up by some of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,abysses of this grotto, or lurked near the entrance, waiting my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,departure, or had made his exit at another and distant aperture, was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unknown to me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Exhausted and discouraged, I prepared, at length, to return. It was easy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to find my way out of this wilderness by going forward in one direction,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regardless of impediments and cross-paths. My absence I believed to have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasioned no alarm to my family, since they knew not of my intention to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spend the night abroad. Thus unsatisfactorily terminated this night's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,adventures.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter III.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The ensuing day was spent partly in sleep, and partly in languor and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disquietude. I incessantly ruminated on the incidents of the last night.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The scheme that I had formed was defeated. Was it likely that this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unknown person would repeat his midnight visits to the elm? If he did,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and could again be discovered, should I resolve to undertake a new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pursuit, which might terminate abortively, or in some signal disaster?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But what proof had I that the same route would be taken, and that he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would again inter himself alive in the same spot? Or, if he did, since
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his reappearance would sufficiently prove that the cavern was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dangerous, and that he who should adventure in might hope to come out
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,again in safety, why not enter it after him? What could be the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inducements of this person to betake himself to subterranean retreats?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The basis of all this region is _limestone_; a substance that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eminently abounds in rifts and cavities. These, by the gradual decay of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their cementing parts, frequently make their appearance in spots where
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they might have been least expected. My attention has often been excited
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by the hollow sound which was produced by my casual footsteps, and which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,showed me that I trod upon the roof of caverns. A mountain-cave and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rumbling of an unseen torrent are appendages of this scene, dear to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,youthful imagination. Many of romantic structure were found within the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precincts of Norwalk.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These I had industriously sought out; but this had hitherto escaped my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,observation, and I formed the resolution of some time exploring it. At
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,present I determined to revisit the elm, and dig in the spot where this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,person had been employed in a similar way. It might be that something
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was here deposited which might exhibit this transaction in a new light.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At the suitable hour, on the ensuing night, I took my former stand. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,person again appeared. My intention to dig was to be carried into effect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on condition of his absence, and was, consequently, frustrated.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Instead of rushing on him, and breaking at once the spell by which his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,senses were bound, I concluded, contrary to my first design, to wait his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,departure, and allow myself to be conducted whithersoever he pleased.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The track into which he now led me was different from the former one. It
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was a maze, oblique, circuitous, upward and downward, in a degree which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,only could take place in a region so remarkably irregular in surface, so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,abounding with hillocks and steeps and pits and brooks, as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,_Solesbury_. It seemed to be the sole end of his labours to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bewilder or fatigue his pursuer, to pierce into the deepest thickets, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plunge into the darkest cavities, to ascend the most difficult heights,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and approach the slippery and tremulous verge of the dizziest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precipices.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I disdained to be outstripped in this career. All dangers were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,overlooked, and all difficulties defied. I plunged into obscurities, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,clambered over obstacles, from which, in a different state of mind, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with a different object of pursuit, I should have recoiled with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,invincible timidity. When the scene had passed, I could not review the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perils I had undergone without shuddering.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At length my conductor struck into a path which, compared with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ruggedness of that which we had lately trodden, was easy and smooth.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This track led us to the skirt of the wilderness, and at no long time we
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reached an open field, when a dwelling appeared, at a small distance,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I speedily recognised to be that belonging to Inglefield. I now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,anticipated the fulfilment of my predictions. My conductor directed his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steps towards the barn, into which he entered by a small door.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How were my doubts removed! This was no other than Clithero Edny. There
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was nothing in his appearance incompatible with this conclusion. He and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his fellow-servant occupied an apartment in the barn as a lodging-room.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This arduous purpose was accomplished, and I retired to the shelter of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,neighbouring shed, not so much to repose myself after the fatigues of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extraordinary journey, as to devise further expedients.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Nothing now remained but to take Clithero to task; to repeat to him the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,observations of the two last nights; to unfold to him my conjectures and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspicions; to convince him of the rectitude of my intentions; and to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extort from him a disclosure of all the circumstances connected with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,death of Waldegrave which it was in his power to communicate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In order to obtain a conference, I resolved to invite him to my uncle's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to perform a certain piece of work for me under my own eyes. He would,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of course, spend the night with us, and in the evening I would take an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opportunity of entering into conversation with him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A period of the deepest deliberation was necessary to qualify myself for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,performing suitably my part in this projected interview. I attended to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the feelings that were suggested in this new state of my knowledge. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,found reason to confide in my newly-acquired equanimity. "Remorse," said
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I, "is an ample and proper expiation for all offences. What does
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vengeance desire but to inflict misery? If misery come, its desires are
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accomplished. It is only the obdurate and exulting criminal that is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,worthy of our indignation. It is common for pity to succeed the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bitterest suggestions of resentment. If the vengeful mind be delighted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with the spectacle of woes of its own contriving, at least its canine
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hunger is appeased, and thenceforth its hands are inactive."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On the evening of the next day, I paid a visit to Inglefield. I wished
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to impart to him the discoveries that I had made, and to listen to his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reflections on the subject. I likewise desired to obtain all possible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,information from the family respecting the conduct of Clithero.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My friend received me with his usual kindness. Thou art no stranger to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his character; thou knowest with what paternal affection I have ever
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been regarded by this old man; with what solicitude the wanderings of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reason and my freaks of passion have been noted and corrected by him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thou knowest his activity to save the life of thy brother, and the hours
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that have been spent by him in aiding my conjectures as to the cause of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his death, and inculcating the lessons of penitence and duty.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The topics which could not but occur at such a meeting were quickly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discussed, and I hastily proceeded to that subject which was nearest my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heart. I related the adventures of the two preceding nights, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mentioned the inference to which they irresistibly led.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He said that this inference coincided with suspicions he had formed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,since our last interview, in consequence of certain communications from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his housekeeper. It seems the character of Clithero had, from the first,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exercised the inquisitiveness of this old lady. She had carefully marked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his musing and melancholy deportment. She had tried innumerable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expedients for obtaining a knowledge of his past life, and particularly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his motives for coming to America. These expedients, however profound
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and addressful, had failed. He took no pains to elude them. He contented
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,himself with turning a deaf ear to all indirect allusions and hints,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, when more explicitly questioned, with simply declaring that he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing to communicate worthy of her notice.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,During the day he was a sober and diligent workman. His evenings he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spent in incommunicative silence. On Sundays, he always rambled away, no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,one knew whither, and without a companion. I have already observed that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he and his fellow-servant occupied the same apartment in the barn. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumstance was not unattended to by Miss Inglefield. The name of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero's companion was Ambrose. This man was copiously interrogated by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his mistress, and she found him by no means so refractory as the other.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Ambrose, in his tedious and confused way, related that, soon after
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero and he had become bedfellows, the former was considerably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disturbed by restlessness and talking in his sleep. His discourse was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incoherent. It was generally in the tone of expostulation, and appeared
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to be entreating to be saved from some great injury. Such phrases as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these,--"have pity;" "have mercy," were frequently intermingled with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,groans, and accompanied with weeping. Sometimes he seemed to be holding
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conferences with some one who was making him considerable offers on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,condition of his performing some dangerous service. What he said in his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,own person, and in answer to his imaginary tempter, testified the utmost
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reluctance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Ambrose had no curiosity on the subject. As this interruption prevented
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him at first from sleeping, it was his custom to put an end to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dialogue, by awakening his companion, who betrayed tokens of great alarm
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and dejection on discovering how he had been employed. He would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solicitously inquire what were the words that he had uttered; but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Ambrose's report was seldom satisfactory, because he had attended to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them but little, and because he grudged every moment in which he was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deprived of his accustomed repose.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Whether Clithero had ceased from this practice, or habit had reconciled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his companion to the sounds, they no longer occasioned any interruption
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to his slumber.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,No one appeared more shocked than he at the death of Waldegrave. After
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this event his dejection suddenly increased. This symptom was observed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by the family, but none but the housekeeper took the trouble to notice
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it to him, or build conjectures on the incident. During nights, however,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Ambrose experienced a renewal of his ancient disturbances. He remarked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that Clithero, one night, had disappeared from his side. Ambrose's range
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of reflection was extremely narrow. Quickly falling asleep, and finding
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his companion beside him when he awoke, he dismissed it from his mind.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On several ensuing nights he awakened in like manner, and always found
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his companion's place empty. The repetition of so strange an incident at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length incited him to mention it to Clithero. The latter was confounded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at this intelligence. He questioned Ambrose with great anxiety as to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,particulars of this event, but he could gain no satisfaction from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stupid inattention of the other. From this time there was a visible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,augmentation of his sadness. His fits of taciturnity became more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obstinate, and a deeper gloom sat upon his brow.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was one other circumstance, of particular importance, mentioned by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the housekeeper. One evening some one on horseback stopped at this gate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He rattled at the gate, with an air of authority, in token of his desire
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that some one would come from the house. Miss Inglefield was employed in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the kitchen, from a window of which she perceived who it was that made
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the signal. Clithero happened, at the same moment, to be employed near
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her. She, therefore, desired him to go and see whom the stranger wanted.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He laid aside his work and went. The conference lasted above five
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,minutes. The length of it excited in her a faint degree of surprise,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inducing her to leave her employment and pay an unintermitted attention
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the scene. There was nothing, however, but its duration that rendered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it remarkable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero at length entered, and the traveller proceeded. The countenance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the former betrayed a degree of perturbation which she had never
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,witnessed before. The muscles of his face were distorted and tremulous.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He immediately sat down to his work, but he seemed, for some time, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have lost all power over his limbs. He struggled to avoid the sight of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the lady, and his gestures, irresolute or misdirected, betokened the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deepest dismay. After some time, he recovered, in some degree, his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,self-possession; but, while the object was viewed through a new medium,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the change existed only in the imagination of the observer, a change
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was certainly discovered.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These circumstances were related to me by Inglefield and corroborated by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his housekeeper. One consequence inevitably flowed from them. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sleep-walker, he who had led me through so devious a tract, was no other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,than Clithero. There was, likewise, a strong relation between this person
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and him who stopped at the gate. What was the subject of discourse between
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them? In answer to Miss Inglefield's interrogatories, he merely said
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that the traveller inquired whither the road led which, at a small
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance forward, struck out of the principal one. Considering the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length of the interview, it was not likely that this was the only topic.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My determination to confer with him in private acquired new force from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these reflections. Inglefield assented to my proposal. His own affairs
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would permit the absence of his servant for one day. I saw no necessity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for delay, and immediately made my request to Clithero. I was fashioning
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an implement, I told him, with respect to which I could not wholly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depend upon my own skill. I was acquainted with the dexterity of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contrivances, and the neatness of his workmanship. He readily consented
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to assist me on this occasion. Next day he came. Contrary to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expectation, he prepared to return home in the evening. I urged him to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spend the night with us: but no; it was equally convenient, and more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,agreeable to him, to return.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was not aware of this resolution. I might, indeed, have foreseen that,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being conscious of his infirmity, he would desire to avoid the scrutiny
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of strangers. I was painfully disconcerted; but it occurred to me, that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the best that could be done was to bear him company, and seize some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opportunity, during this interval, of effecting my purpose. I told him,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that, since he would not remain, I cared not if, for the sake of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recreation, and of a much more momentous purpose, I went along with him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He tacitly, and without apparent reluctance, consented to my scheme,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, accordingly, we set off together. This was an awful crisis. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time had now come that was to dissipate my uncertainty. By what means
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should I introduce a topic so momentous and singular? I had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,qualified by no experience for rightly conducting myself on so critical
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an emergency. My companion preserved a mournful and inviolable silence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He afforded me no opening by which I might reach the point in view. His
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,demeanour was sedate, while I was almost disabled, by the confusion of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my thoughts, to utter a word.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was a dreadful charge that I was about to insinuate. I was to accuse
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my companion of nothing less than murder. I was to call upon him for an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,avowal of his guilt. I was to state the ground of my suspicions, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desire him to confute or confirm them. In doing this, I was principally
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stimulated by an ungovernable curiosity; yet, if I intended not the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conferring of a benefit, I did not, at least, purpose the infliction of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,evil. I persuaded myself that I was able to exclude from my bosom all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sanguinary or vengeful impulses; and that, whatever should be the issue
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of this conversation, my equanimity would be unsubdued.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I revolved various modes of introducing the topic by which my mind was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,engaged. I passed rapidly from one to another. None of them were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficiently free from objection to allow me to adopt it. My perplexity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,became, every moment, more painful, and my ability to extricate myself,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,less.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In this state of uncertainty, so much time elapsed, that the elm at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length appeared in sight. This object had somewhat of a mechanical
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,influence upon me. I stopped short, and seized the arm of my companion.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Till this moment, he appeared to have been engrossed by his own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reflections, and not to have heeded those emotions which must have been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficiently conspicuous in my looks.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This action recalled him from his reverie. The first idea that occurred
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to him, when he had noticed my behaviour, was, that I was assailed by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some sudden indisposition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What is the matter?" said he, in a tone of anxiety: "are you not well?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Yes," replied I,--"perfectly well. But stop a moment; I have something
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to say to you."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"To me?" answered he, with surprise.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Yes," said I. "Let us turn down this path," (pointing, at the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time, to that along which I had followed him the preceding night.)
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He now partook, in some degree, of my embarrassment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Is there any thing particular?" said he, in a doubting accent. There he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stopped.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Something," I answered, "of the highest moment. Go with me down this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,path. We shall be in less danger of interruption."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He was irresolute and silent, but, seeing me remove the bars and pass
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,through them, he followed me. Nothing more was said till we entered the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wood. I trusted to the suggestions of the moment. I had now gone too far
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to recede, and the necessity that pressed upon me supplied me with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,words. I continued:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This is a remarkable spot. You may wonder why I have led you to it. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ought not to keep you in suspense. There is a tale connected with it,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I am desirous of telling you. For this purpose I have brought you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hither. Listen to me."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I then recapitulated the adventures of the two preceding nights. I added
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing, nor retrenched any thing. He listened in the deepest silence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,From every incident, he gathered new cause of alarm. Repeatedly he wiped
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his face with his handkerchief, and sighed deeply. I took no verbal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,notice of these symptoms. I deemed it incumbent on me to repress
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing. When I came to the concluding circumstance, by which his person
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was identified, he heard me without any new surprise. To this narrative
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I subjoined the inquiries that I had made at Inglefield's, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,result of those inquiries. I then continued in these words:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"You may ask why I subjected myself to all this trouble. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mysteriousness of these transactions would have naturally suggested
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,curiosity in any one. A transient passenger would probably have acted as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I have done. But I had motives peculiar to myself. Need I remind you of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a late disaster? That it happened beneath the shade of this tree? Am I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not justified in drawing certain inferences from your behaviour? What
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they are, I leave you to judge. Be it your task to confute or confirm
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them. For this end I have conducted you hither.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My suspicions are vehement. How can they be otherwise? I call upon you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to say whether they be just."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The spot where we stood was illuminated by the moon, that had now risen,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,though all around was dark. Hence his features and person were easily
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinguished. His hands hung at his side. His eyes were downcast, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he was motionless as a statue. My last words seemed scarcely to have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made any impression on his sense. I had no need to provide against the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible suggestions of revenge. I felt nothing but the tenderness of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compassion. I continued, for some time, to observe him in silence, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could discover no tokens of a change of mood. I could not forbear, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,last, to express my uneasiness at the fixedness of his features and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attitude.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Recollect yourself. I mean not to urge you too closely. This topic is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solemn, but it need not divest you of the fortitude becoming a man."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sound of my voice startled him. He broke from me, looked up, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fixed his eyes upon me with an expression of affright. He shuddered and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recoiled as from a spectre. I began to repent of my experiment. I could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,say nothing suitable to this occasion. I was obliged to stand a silent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and powerless spectator, and to suffer this paroxysm to subside of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,itself. When its violence appeared to be somewhat abated, I resumed:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I can feel for you. I act not thus in compliance with a temper that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,delights in the misery of others. The explanation that I have solicited
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,is no less necessary for your sake than for mine. You are no stranger to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the light in which I viewed this man. You have witnessed the grief which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his fate occasioned, and the efforts that I made to discover and drag to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,punishment his murderer. You heard the execrations that I heaped upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him, and my vows of eternal revenge. You expect that, having detected
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the offender, I will hunt him to infamy and death. You are mistaken. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consider the deed as sufficiently expiated.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I am no stranger to your gnawing cares; to the deep and incurable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,despair that haunts you, to which your waking thoughts are a prey, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from which sleep cannot secure you. I know the enormity of your crime,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but I know not your inducements. Whatever they were, I see the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequences with regard to yourself. I see proofs of that remorse which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,must ever be attendant on guilt.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This is enough. Why should the effects of our misdeeds be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inexhaustible? Why should we be debarred from a comforter? An
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opportunity of repairing our errors may, at least, be demanded from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rulers of our destiny.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I once imagined that he who killed Waldegrave inflicted the greatest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible injury on me. That was an error, which reflection has cured.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Were futurity laid open to my view, and events, with their consequences,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unfolded, I might see reason to embrace the assassin as my best friend.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Be comforted."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He was still incapable of speaking; but tears came to his relief.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Without attending to my remonstrances, he betrayed a disposition to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,return. I had, hitherto, hoped for some disclosure, but now feared that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it was designed to be withheld. He stopped not till we reached
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Inglefield's piazza. He then spoke, for the first time, but in a hollow
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and tremulous voice:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"You demand of me a confession of crimes. You shall have it. Some time
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you shall have it. When it will be, I cannot tell. Something must be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,done, and shortly."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He hurried from me into the house, and, after a pause, I turned my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steps home wards. My reflections, as I proceeded, perpetually revolved
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,round a single point. These were scarcely more than a repetition, with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,slight variations, of a single idea.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,When I awoke in the morning, I hied, in fancy, to the wilderness. I saw
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing but the figure of the wanderer before me. I traced his footsteps
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,anew, retold my narrative, and pondered on his gestures and words. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,condition was not destitute of enjoyment. My stormy passions had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subsided into a calm, portentous and awful. My soul was big with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expectation. I seemed as if I were on the eve of being ushered into a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,world whose scenes were tremendous but sublime. The suggestions of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sorrow and malice had, for a time, taken their flight, and yielded place
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to a generous sympathy, which filled my eyes with tears, but had more in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it of pleasure than of pain. That Clithero was instrumental to the death
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of Waldegrave, that he could furnish the clue explanatory of every
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bloody and mysterious event that had hitherto occurred, there was no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,longer the possibility of doubting. "He, indeed," said I, "is the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,murderer of excellence; and yet it shall be my province to emulate a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,father's clemency, and restore this unhappy man to purity and to peace."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Day after day passed, without hearing any thing of Clithero. I began to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grow uneasy and impatient. I had gained so much, and by means so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unexpected, that I could more easily endure uncertainty with respect to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,what remained to be known. But my patience had its limits. I should,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,doubtless, have made use of new means to accelerate this discovery, had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not his timely appearance made them superfluous.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sunday being at length arrived, I resolved to go to Inglefield's, seek
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an interview with his servant, and urge him, by new importunities, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confide to me the secret. On my way thither, Clithero appeared in sight.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His visage was pale and wan, and his form emaciated and shrunk. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,astonished at the alteration which the lapse of a week had made in his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appearance. At a small distance I mistook him for a stranger. As soon as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I perceived who it was, I greeted him with the utmost friendliness. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,civilities made little impression on him, and he hastened to inform me,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that he was coming to my uncle's, for the purpose of meeting and talking
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with me. If I thought proper, we would go into the wood together, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,find some spot where we might discourse at our leisure and be exempt
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from interruption.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You will easily conceive with what alacrity I accepted his invitation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,We returned from the road into the first path, and proceeded in silence,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,till the wildness of the surrounding scenery informed us that we were in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the heart of Norwalk. We lighted on a recess, to which my companion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appeared to be familiar, and which had all the advantages of solitude,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and was suitable to rest. Here we stopped. Hitherto my companion had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,displayed a certain degree of composure. Now his countenance betokened a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,violent internal struggle. It was a considerable time before he could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,command his speech. When he had so far effected the conquest of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,feelings, he began.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter IV.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You call upon me for a confession of my offences. What a strange fortune
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,is mine! That a human being, in the present circumstances, should make
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this demand, and that I should be driven, by an irresistible necessity,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to comply with it! That here should terminate my calamitous series! That
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my destiny should call upon me to lie down and die, in a region so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remote from the scene of my crime; at a distance so great from all that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,witnessed and endured their consequences!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You believe me to be an assassin. You require me to explain the motives
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that induced me to murder the innocent. While this is your belief, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this the scope of your expectations, you may be sure of my compliance. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could resist every demand but this.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,For what purpose have I come hither? Is it to relate my story? Shall I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,calmly sit here, and rehearse the incidents of my life? Will my strength
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be adequate to this rehearsal? Let me recollect the motives that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,governed me, when I formed this design. Perhaps a strenuousness may be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imparted by them which, otherwise, I cannot hope to obtain. For the sake
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of those, I consent to conjure up the ghost of the past, and to begin a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tale that, with a fortitude like mine, I am not sure that I shall live
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to finish.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You are unacquainted with the man before you. The inferences which you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have drawn, with regard to my designs and my conduct, are a tissue of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destructive errors. You, like others, are blind to the most momentous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequences of your own actions. You talk of imparting consolation. You
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,boast the beneficence of your intentions. You set yourself to do me a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benefit. What are the effects of your misguided zeal and random efforts?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,They have brought my life to a miserable close. They have shrouded the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,last scene of it in blood. They have put the seal to my perdition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My misery has been greater than has fallen to the lot of mortals. Yet it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,is but beginning. My present path, full as it is of asperities, is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,better than that into which I must enter when this is abandoned.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Perhaps, if my pilgrimage had been longer, I might, at some future day,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have lighted upon hope. In consequence of your interference, I am
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forever debarred from it. My existence is henceforward to be invariable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The woes that are reserved for me are incapable alike of alleviation or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intermission.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But I came not hither to recriminate. I came not hither to accuse
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,others, but myself. I know the retribution that is appointed for guilt
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,like mine. It is just. I may shudder at the foresight of my punishment
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and shrink in the endurance of it; but I shall be indebted for part of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my torment to the vigour of my understanding, which teaches me that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,punishment is just. Why should I procrastinate my doom and strive to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,render my burden more light? It is but just that it should crush me. Its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,procrastination is impossible. The stroke is already felt. Even now I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,drink of the cup of retribution. A change of being cannot aggravate my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,woe. Till consciousness itself be extinct, the worm that gnaws me will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,never perish.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Fain would I be relieved from this task. Gladly would I bury in oblivion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the transactions of my life. But no! My fate is uniform. The demon that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,controlled me at first is still in the fruition of power. I am entangled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in his fold, and every effort that I make to escape only involves me in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deeper ruin. I need not conceal, for all the consequences of disclosure
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,are already experienced. I cannot endure a groundless imputation, though
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to free me from it I must create and justify imputations still more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,atrocious. My story may at least be brief. If the agonies of remembrance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,must be awakened afresh, let me do all that in me lies to shorten them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was born in the county of Armagh. My parents were of the better sort
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of peasants, and were able to provide me with the rudiments of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowledge. I should doubtless have trodden in their footsteps, and have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spent my life in the cultivation of their scanty fields, if an event had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not happened, Which, for a long time, I regarded as the most fortunate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my life, but which I now regard as the scheme of some infernal agent,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and as the primary source of all my calamities.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My father's farm was a portion of the demesne of one who resided wholly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the metropolis and consigned the management of his estates to his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stewards and retainers. This person married a lady who brought him great
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accession of fortune. Her wealth was her only recommendation in the eyes
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her husband, (whose understanding was depraved by the prejudices of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,luxury and rank,) but was the least of her attractions in the estimate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of reasonable beings.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,They passed some years together. If their union were not a source of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,misery to the lady, she was indebted for her tranquillity to the force
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her mind. She was, indeed, governed, in every action of her life, by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the precepts of duty, while her husband listened to no calls but those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of pernicious dissipation. He was immersed in all the vices that grow
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,out of opulence and a mistaken education.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Happily for his wife, his career was short. He was enraged at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,infidelity of his mistress, to purchase whose attachment he had lavished
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,two-thirds of his fortune. He called the paramour, by whom he had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supplanted, to the field. The contest was obstinate, and terminated in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the death of the challenger.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This event freed the lady from many distressful and humiliating
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obligations. She determined to profit by her newly-acquired
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,independence, to live thenceforward conformably to her notions of right,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to preserve and improve, by schemes of economy, the remains of her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortune, and to employ it in the diffusion of good. Her plans made it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,necessary to visit her estates in the distant provinces.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,During her abode in the manor of which my father was a vassal, she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,visited his cottage. I was at that time a child. She was pleased with my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vivacity and promptitude, and determined to take me under her own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,protection. My parents joyfully acceded to her proposal, and I returned
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with her to the capital.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She had an only son of my own age. Her design, in relation to me, was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I should be educated with her child, and that an affection, in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,way, might be excited in me towards my young master, which might render
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me, when we should attain to manhood, one of his most faithful and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intelligent dependants. I enjoyed, equally with him, all the essential
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benefits of education. There were certain accomplishments, from which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was excluded, from the belief that they were unsuitable to my rank and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,station. I was permitted to acquire others, which, had she been actuated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by true discernment, she would, perhaps, have discovered to be far more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incompatible with a servile station. In proportion as my views were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,refined and enlarged by history and science, I was likely to contract a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thirst of independence, and an impatience of subjection and poverty.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,When the period of childhood and youth was past, it was thought proper
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to send her son to improve his knowledge and manners by a residence on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the continent. This young man was endowed with splendid abilities. His
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,errors were the growth of his condition. All the expedients that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maternal solicitude and wisdom could suggest were employed to render him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a useful citizen. Perhaps this wisdom was attested by the large share of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,excellence which he really possessed; and that his character was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unblemished proved only that no exertions could preserve him from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vices that are inherent in wealth and rank, and which flow from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spectacle of universal depravity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As to me, it would be folly to deny that I had benefited by my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opportunities of improvement. I fulfilled the expectation of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mistress, in one respect. I was deeply imbued with affection for her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,son, and reverence for herself. Perhaps the force of education was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,evinced in those particulars, without reflecting any credit on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,directors of it. Those might merit the name of defects, which were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regarded by them as accomplishments. My unfavourable qualities, like
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,those of my master, were imputed to my condition, though, perhaps, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,difference was advantageous to me, since the vices of servitude are less
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hateful than those of tyranny.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was resolved that I should accompany my master in his travels, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quality of favourite domestic. My principles, whatever might be their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rectitude, were harmonious and flexible. I had devoted my life to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,service of my patron. I had formed conceptions of what was really
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conducive to his interest, and was not to be misled by specious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appearances. If my affection had not stimulated my diligence, I should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have found sufficient motives in the behaviour of his mother. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,condescended to express her reliance on my integrity and judgment. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was not ashamed to manifest, at parting, the tenderness of a mother, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to acknowledge that all her tears were not shed on her son's account. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had my part in the regrets that called them forth.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,During our absence, I was my master's constant attendant. I corresponded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with his mother, and made the conduct of her son the principal theme of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my letters. I deemed it my privilege, as well as duty, to sit in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,judgment on his actions, to form my opinions without regard to selfish
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,considerations, and to avow them whenever the avowal tended to benefit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Every letter which I wrote, particularly those in which his behaviour
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was freely criticized, I allowed him to peruse. I would, on no account,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,connive at or participate in the slightest irregularity. I knew the duty
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my station, and assumed no other control than that which resulted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the avoiding of deceit, and the open expression of my sentiments.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The youth was of a noble spirit, but his firmness was wavering. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,yielded to temptations which a censor less rigorous than I would have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regarded as venial, or, perhaps, laudable. My duty required me to set
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before him the consequences of his actions, and to give impartial and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,timely information to his mother.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He could not brook a monitor. The more he needed reproof the less
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supportable it became. My company became every day less agreeable, till
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at length there appeared a necessity of parting. A separation took
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,place, but not as enemies. I never lost his respect. In his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,representations to his mother, he was just to my character and services.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My dismission was not allowed to injure my fortune, and his mother
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,considered this event merely as a new proof of the inflexible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consistency of my principles.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On this change in my situation, she proposed to me to become a member of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her own family. No proposal could be more acceptable. I was fully
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acquainted with the character of this lady, and had nothing to fear from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,injustice and caprice. I did not regard her with filial familiarity, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my attachment and reverence would have done honour to that relation. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,performed for her the functions of a steward. Her estates in the city
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were put under my direction. She placed boundless confidence in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discretion and integrity, and consigned to me the payment, and, in some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,degree, the selection and government, of her servants. My station was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,servile one, yet most of the evils of servitude were unknown to me. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,personal ease and independence were less infringed than that of those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who are accounted the freest members of society. I derived a sort of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,authority and dignity from the receipt and disbursement of money. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tenants and debtors of the lady were, in some respects, mine. It was,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for the most part, on my justice and lenity that they depended for their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,treatment. My lady's household-establishment was large and opulent. Her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,servants were my inferiors and menials. My leisure was considerable, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my emoluments large enough to supply me with every valuable instrument
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of improvement or pleasure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These were reasons why I should be contented with my lot. These
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumstances alone would have rendered it more eligible than any other,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but it had additional and far more powerful recommendations, arising
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the character of Mrs. Lorimer, and from the relation in which she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,allowed me to stand to her.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How shall I enter upon this theme? How shall I expatiate upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,excellencies which it was my fate to view in their genuine colours, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,adore with an immeasurable and inextinguishable ardour, and which,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nevertheless, it was my hateful task to blast and destroy? Yet I will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not be spared. I shall find, in the rehearsal, new incitements to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sorrow. I deserve to be supreme in misery, and will not be denied the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,full measure of a bitter retribution.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,No one was better qualified to judge of her excellencies. A casual
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spectator might admire her beauty, and the dignity of her demeanour.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,From the contemplation of those, he might gather motives for loving or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,revering her. Age was far from having withered her complexion, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destroyed the evenness of her skin; but no time could rob her of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sweetness and intelligence which animated her features. Her habitual
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beneficence was bespoken in every look. Always in search of occasions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for doing good, always meditating scenes of happiness, of which she was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the author, or of distress, for which she was preparing relief, the most
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,torpid insensibility was, for a time, subdued, and the most depraved
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,smitten by charms of which, in another person, they would not perhaps
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have been sensible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A casual visitant might enjoy her conversation, might applaud the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rectitude of her sentiments, the richness of her elocution, and her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,skill in all the offices of politeness. But it was only for him who
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dwelt constantly under the same roof, to mark the inviolable consistency
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her actions and opinions, the ceaseless flow of her candour, her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cheerfulness, and her benevolence. It was only for one who witnessed her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,behaviour at all hours, in sickness and in health, her management of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that great instrument of evil and good, money, her treatment of her son,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her menials, and her kindred, rightly to estimate her merits.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The intercourse between us was frequent, but of a peculiar kind. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,office in her family required me often to see her, to submit schemes to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her consideration, and receive her directions. At these times she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,treated me in a manner in some degree adapted to the difference of rank
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the inferiority of my station, and yet widely dissimilar from that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which a different person would have adopted in the same circumstances.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The treatment was not that of an equal and a friend, but still more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remote was it from that of a mistress. It was merely characterized by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,affability and condescension, but as such it had no limits.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She made no scruple to ask my counsel in every pecuniary affair, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,listen to my arguments, and decide conformably to what, after sufficient
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,canvassings and discussions, should appear to be right. When the direct
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasions of our interview were dismissed, I did not of course withdraw.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To detain or dismiss me was indeed at her option; but, if no engagement
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interfered, she would enter into general conversation. There was none
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who could with more safety to herself have made the world her confessor;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but the state of society in which she lived imposed certain limitations
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on her candour. In her intercourse with me there were fewer restraints
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,than on any other occasion. My situation had made me more intimately
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acquainted with domestic transactions, with her views respecting her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,son, and with the terms on which she thought proper to stand with those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom old acquaintance or kindred gave some title to her good offices. In
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,addition to all those motives to a candid treatment of me, there were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,others which owed their efficacy to her maternal regard for me, and to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the artless and unsuspecting generosity of her character.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Her hours were distributed with the utmost regularity, and appropriated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the best purposes. She selected her society without regard to any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,qualities but probity and talents. Her associates were numerous, and her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,evening conversations embellished with all that could charm the senses
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or instruct the understanding. This was a chosen field for the display
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her magnificence; but her grandeur was unostentatious, and her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gravity unmingled with haughtiness. From these my station excluded me;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but I was compensated by the freedom of her communications in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intervals. She found pleasure in detailing to me the incidents that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passed on those occasions, in rehearsing conversations and depicting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,characters. There was an uncommon portion of dramatic merit in her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recitals, besides valuable and curious information. One uniform effect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was produced in me by this behaviour. Each day I thought it impossible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for my attachment to receive any new accessions, yet the morrow was sure
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to produce some new emotion of respect or of gratitude, and to set the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unrivalled accomplishments of this lady in a new and more favourable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,point of view. I contemplated no change in my condition. The necessity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of change, whatever were the alternative, would have been a subject of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,piercing regret. I deemed my life a cheap sacrifice in her cause. No
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time would suffice to discharge the debt of gratitude that was due to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her. Yet it was continually accumulating. If an anxious thought ever
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,invaded my bosom, it arose from this source.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was no difficult task faithfully to execute the functions assigned to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me. No merit could accrue to me from this source. I was exposed to no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,temptation. I had passed the feverish period of youth. No contagious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,example had contaminated my principles. I had resisted, the allurements
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of sensuality and dissipation incident to my age. My dwelling was in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pomp and splendour. I had amassed sufficient to secure me, in case of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unforeseen accidents, in the enjoyment of competence. My mental
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resources were not despicable, and the external means of intellectual
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gratification were boundless. I enjoyed an unsullied reputation. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,character was well known in that sphere which my lady occupied, not only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by means of her favourable report, but in numberless ways in which it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was my fortune to perform personal services to others.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter V.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Mrs. Lorimer had a twin-brother. Nature had impressed the same image
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon them, and had modelled them after the same pattern. The resemblance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,between them was exact to a degree almost incredible. In infancy and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,childhood they were perpetually liable to be mistaken for each other. As
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they grew up, nothing, to a superficial examination, appeared to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinguish them, but the sexual characteristics. A sagacious observer
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would, doubtless, have noted the most essential differences. In all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,those modifications of the features which are produced by habits and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sentiments, no two persons were less alike. Nature seemed to have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intended them as examples of the futility of those theories which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascribe every thing to conformation and instinct and nothing to external
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumstances; in what different modes the same materials may be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fashioned, and to what different purposes the same materials may be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,applied. Perhaps the rudiments of their intellectual character, as well
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as of their form, were the same; but the powers that in one case were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exerted in the cause of virtue were, in the other, misapplied to sordid
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and flagitious purposes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Arthur Wiatte (that was his name) had ever been the object of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sister's affection. As long as he existed, she never ceased to labour in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the promotion of his happiness. All her kindness was repaid by a stern
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and inexorable hatred. This man was an exception to all the rules which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,govern us in our judgments of human nature. He exceeded in depravity all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that has been imputed to the arch-foe of mankind. His wickedness was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without any of those remorseful intermissions from which it has been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supposed that the deepest guilt is not entirely exempt. He seemed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,relish no food but pure unadulterated evil. He rejoiced in proportion to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the depth of that distress of which he was the author.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His sister, by being placed most within the reach of his enmity,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,experienced its worst effects. She was the subject on which, by being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acquainted with the means of influencing her happiness, he could try his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,malignant experiments with most hope of success. Her parents being high
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in rank and wealth, the marriage of their daughter was, of course, an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,object of anxious attention. There is no event on which our felicity and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,usefulness more materially depends, and with regard to which, therefore,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the freedom of choice and the exercise of our own understanding ought to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be less infringed; but this maxim is commonly disregarded in proportion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the elevation of our rank and extent of our property.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The lady made her own election; but she wras one of those who acted on a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,comprehensive plan, and would not admit her private inclination to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dictate her decision. The happiness of others, though founded on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mistaken views, she did not consider as unworthy of her regard. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,choice was such as was not likely to obtain the parental sanction, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom the moral qualities of their son-in-law, though not absolutely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,weightless in the balance, were greatly inferior to the considerations
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of wealth and dignity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The brother set no value on any thing but the means of luxury and power.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He was astonished at that perverseness which entertained a different
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conception of happiness from himself. Love and friendship he considered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as groundless and chimerical, and believed that those delusions would,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in people of sense, be rectified by experience; but he knew the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obstinacy of his sister's attachment to these phantoms, and that to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bereave her of the good they promised was the most effectual means of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rendering her miserable. For this end he set himself to thwart her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wishes. In the imbecility and false indulgence of his parents he found
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the most powerful auxiliaries. He prevailed upon them to forbid that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,union which wanted nothing but their concurrence, and their consent to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,endow her with a small portion of their patrimony, to render completely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eligible. The cause was that of her happiness and the happiness of him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on whom she had bestowed her heart. It behooved her, therefore, to call
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forth all her energies in defence of it, to weaken her brother's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,influence on the minds of her parents, or to win him to be her advocate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,When I reflect upon her mental powers, and the advantages which should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seem to flow from the circumstance of pleading in the character of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,daughter arid sister, I can scarcely believe that her attempts
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,miscarried. I should have imagined that all obstacles would yield before
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her, and particularly in a case like this, in which she must have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,summoned all her forces, and never have believed that she had struggled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficiently.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Certain it is that her lot was fixed. She was not only denied the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,husband of her choice, but another was imposed upon her, whose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recommendations were irresistible in every one's apprehension but her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,own. The discarded lover was treated with every sort of contumely.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Deceit and violence were employed by her brother to bring his honour,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his liberty, and even his life, into hazard. All these iniquities
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,produced no inconsiderable effect on the mind of the lady. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,machinations to which her love was exposed would have exasperated him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into madness, had not her most strenuous exertions been directed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appease him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She prevailed on him at length to abandon his country, though she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thereby merely turned her brother's depravity into a new channel. Her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,parents died without consciousness of the evils they inflicted, but they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,experienced a bitter retribution in the conduct of their son. He was the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,darling and stay of an ancient and illustrious house, but his actions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reflected nothing but disgrace upon his ancestry, and threatened to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bring the honours of their line to a period in his person. At their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,death the bulk of their patrimony devolved upon him. This he speedily
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consumed in gaming and riot. From splendid he descended to meaner vices.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The efforts of his sister to recall him to virtue were unintermitted and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fruitless. Her affection for him he converted into a means of prolonging
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his selfish gratifications. She decided for the best. It was no argument
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of weakness that she was so frequently deceived. If she had judged truly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her brother, she would have judged not only without example, but in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opposition to the general experience of mankind. But she was not to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forever deceived. Her tenderness was subservient to justice. And when
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his vices had led him from the gaming-table to the highway, when seized
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at length by the ministers of law, when convicted and sentenced to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,transportation, her intercession was solicited, when all the world knew
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that pardon would readily be granted to a suppliant of her rank,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortune, and character, when the criminal himself, his kindred, his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friends, and even indifferent persons, implored her interference, her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,justice was inflexible. She knew full well the incurableness of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depravity; that banishment was the mildest destiny that would befall
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him; that estrangement from ancient haunts and associates was the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,condition from which his true friends had least to fear. Finding
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entreaties unavailing, the wretch delivered himself to the suggestions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his malice, and he vowed to be bloodily revenged on her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inflexibility. The sentence was executed. That character must indeed be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,monstrous from which the execution of such threats was to be dreaded.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The event sufficiently showed that our fears on this head were well
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grounded. This event, however, was at a great distance. It was reported
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that the felons, of whom he was one, mutinied on board the ship in which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they had been embarked. In the affray that succeeded, it was said that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he was killed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Among the nefarious deeds which he perpetrated was to be numbered the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seduction of a young lady, whose heart was broken by the detection of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his perfidy. The fruit of this unhappy union was a daughter. Her mother
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,died shortly after her birth. Her father was careless of her destiny.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She was consigned to the care of a hireling, who, happily for the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,innocent victim, performed the maternal offices for her own sake, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,did not allow the want of a stipulated recompense to render hor cruel or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,neglectful.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This orphan was sought out by the benevolence of Mrs. Lorimer and placed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,under her own protection. She received from her the treatment of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mother. The ties of kindred, corroborated by habit, was not the only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thing that united them. That resemblance to herself which had been so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deplorably defective in her brother was completely realized in his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,offspring. Nature seemed to have precluded every difference between them
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but that of age. This darling object excited in her bosom more than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maternal sympathies. Her soul clung to the happiness of her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,_Clarice_ with more ardour than to that of her own son. The latter
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was not only less worthy of affection, but their separation necessarily
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,diminished their mutual confidence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was natural for her to look forward to the future destiny of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,_Clarice_. On these occasions she could not help contemplating the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possibility of a union between her son and niece. Considerable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,advantages belonged to this scheme, yet it was the subject of hope
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rather than the scope of a project. The contingencies were numerous and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,delicate on which the ultimate desirableness of this union depended. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was far from certain that her son would be worthy of this benefit, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that, if he were worthy, his propensities would not select for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,themselves a different object. It was equally dubious whether the young
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lady would not think proper otherwise to dispose of her affections.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These uncertainties could be dissipated only by time. Meanwhile she was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chiefly solicitous to render them virtuous and wise.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As they advanced in years, the hopes that she had formed were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,annihilated. The youth was not exempt from egregious errors. In addition
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to this, it was manifest that the young people were disposed to regard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,each other in no other light than that of brother and sister. I was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unapprized of her views. I saw that their union was impossible. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,near enough to judge of the character of Clarice. My youth and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intellectual constitution made me peculiarly susceptible to female
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,charms. I was her playfellow in childhood, and her associate in studies
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and amusements at a maturer age. This situation might have been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspected of a dangerous tendency. This tendency, however, was obviated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by motives of which I was, for a long time, scarcely conscious.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was habituated to consider the distinctions of rank as indelible. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obstructions that existed, to any wish that I might form, were like
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,those of time and space, and, in their own nature, as insuperable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Such was the state of things previous to our setting out upon our
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,travels. Clarice was indirectly included in our correspondence. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,letters were open to her inspection, and I was sometimes honoured with a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,few complimentary lines under her own hand. On returning to my ancient
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,abode, I was once more exposed to those sinister influences which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,absence had at least suspended. Various suitors had, meanwhile, been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rejected. Their character, for the most part, had been such as to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,account for her refusal, without resorting to the supposition of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lurking or unavowed attachment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On our meeting she greeted me in a respectful but dignified manner.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Observers could discover in it nothing not corresponding to that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,difference of fortune which subsisted between us. If her joy, on that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasion, had in it some portion of tenderness, the softness of her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,temper, and the peculiar circumstances in which we had been placed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being considered, the most rigid censor could find no occasion for blame
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or suspicion.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A year passed away, but not without my attention being solicited by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,something new and inexplicable in my own sensations. At first I was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,aware of their true cause; but the gradual progress of my feelings left
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me not long in doubt as to their origin. I was alarmed at the discovery,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but my courage did not suddenly desert me. My hopes seemed to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extinguished the moment that I distinctly perceived the point to which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they led. My mind had undergone a change. The ideas with which it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fraught wrere varied. The sight or recollection of Clarice was sure to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasion my mind to advert to the recent discovery, and to revolve the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,considerations naturally connected with it. Some latent glows and secret
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trepidations were likewise experienced, when, by some accident, our
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,meetings were abrupt or our interviews unwitnessed; yet my usual
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tranquillity was not as yet sensibly diminished. I could bear to think
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her marriage with another without painful emotions, and was anxious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,only that her choice should be judicious and fortunate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My thoughts could not long continue in this state. They gradually became
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more ardent and museful. The image of Clarice occurred with unseasonable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,frequency. Its charms were enhanced by some nameless and indefinable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,additions. When it met me in the way I was irresistibly disposed to stop
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and survey it with particular attention. The pathetic cast of her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,features, the deep glow of her cheek, and some catch of melting music
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,she had lately breathed, stole incessantly upon my fancy. On recovering
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from my thoughtful moods, I sometimes found my cheeks wet with tears
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that had fallen unperceived, and my bosom heaved with involuntary sighs.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These images did not content themselves with invading my wakeful hours,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but, likewise, encroached upon my sleep. I could no longer resign myself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to slumber with the same ease as before. When I slept, my visions were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the same impassioned tenor.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was no difficulty in judging rightly of my situation. I knew what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it was that duty exacted from me. To remain in my present situation was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a chimerical project. That time and reflection would suffice to restore
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me to myself was a notion equally fallacious. Yet I felt an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,insupportable reluctance to change it. This reluctance was owing, not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wholly or chiefly to my growing passion, but to the attachment which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bound me to the service of my lady. All my contemplations had hitherto
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been modelled on the belief of my remaining in my present situation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,during my life. My mildest anticipations had never fashioned an event
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,like this. Any misfortune was light in comparison with that which tore
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me from her presence and service. But, should I ultimately resolve to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,separate, how should I communicate my purpose? The pain of parting would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scarcely be less on her side than on mine. Could I consent to be the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,author of disquietude to her? I had consecrated all my faculties to her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,service. This was the recompense which it was in my power to make for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the benefits that I had received. Would not this procedure bear the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appearance of the basest ingratitude? The shadow of an imputation like
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this was more excruciating than the rack.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What motive could I assign for my conduct? The truth must not be told.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This would be equivalent to supplicating for a new benefit. It would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more become me to lessen than increase my obligations. Among all my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imaginations on this subject, the possibility of a mutual passion never
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occurred to me. I could not be blind to the essential distinctions that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subsist among men. I could expatiate, like others, on the futility of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ribbons and titles, and on the dignity that was annexed to skill and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,virtue; but these, for the most part, were the incoherences of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,speculation, and in no degree influenced the stream of my actions and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,practical sentiments. The barrier that existed in the present case I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deemed insurmountable. This was not even the subject of doubt. In
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disclosing the truth, I should be conceived to be soliciting my lady's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mercy and intercession; but this would be the madness of presumption.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Let me impress her with any other opinion than that I go in search of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the happiness that I have lost under her roof. Let me save her generous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heart from the pangs which this persuasion would infallibly produce.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I could form no stable resolutions. I seemed unalterably convinced of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the necessity of separation, and yet could not execute my design. When I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had wrought up my mind to the intention of explaining myself on the next
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interview, when the next interview took place my tongue was powerless. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,admitted any excuse for postponing my design, and gladly admitted any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,topic, however foreign to my purpose.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It must not be imagined that my health sustained no injury from this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conflict of my passions. My patroness perceived this alteration. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inquired with the most affectionate solicitude into the cause. It could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not be explained. I could safely make light of it, and represented it as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,something which would probably disappear of itself, as it originated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without any adequate cause. She was obliged to acquiesce in my imperfect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,account.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Day after day passed in this state of fluctuation. I was conscious of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the dangers of delay, and that procrastination, without rendering the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,task less necessary, augmented its difficulties. At length, summoning my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resolution, I demanded an audience. She received me with her usual
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,affability. Common topics were started; but she saw the confusion and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trepidation of my thoughts, and quickly relinquished them. She then
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,noticed to me what she had observed, and mentioned the anxiety which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these appearances had given her She reminded me of the maternal regard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which she had always manifested towards me, and appealed to my own heart
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whether any thing could be said in vindication of that reserve with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I had lately treated her, and urged me, as I valued her good
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opinion, to explain the cause of a dejection _that was too
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,visible_.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To all this I could make but one answer:--"Think me not, madam, perverse
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or ungrateful. I came just now to apprize you of a resolution that I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,formed. I cannot explain the motives that induce me. In this case, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lie to you would be unpardonable, and, since I cannot assign my true
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,motives, I will not mislead you by false representations. I came to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inform you of my intention to leave your service, and to retire, with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the fruits of your bounty, to my native village, where I shall spend my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life, I hope, in peace."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Her surprise at this declaration was beyond measure. She could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,believe her ears. She had not heard me rightly. She compelled me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repeat it. Still I was jesting. I could not possibly mean what my words
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imported.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I assured her, in terms still more explicit, that my resolution was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,taken and was unalterable, and again entreated her to spare me the task
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of assigning my motives.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This was a strange determination. What could be the grounds of this new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scheme? What could be the necessity of hiding them from her? This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mystery was not to be endured. She could by no means away with it. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thought it hard that I should abandon her at this time, when she stood
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in particular need of my assistance and advice. She would refuse nothing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to make my situation eligible. I had only to point out where she was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deficient in her treatment of me, and she would endeavour to supply it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She was willing to augment my emoluments in any degree that I desired.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She could not think of parting with me; but, at any rate, she must be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,informed of my motives.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"It is a hard task," answered I, "that I have imposed upon myself. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,foresaw its difficulties, and this foresight has hitherto prevented me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from undertaking it; but the necessity by which I am impelled will no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,longer be withstood. I am determined to go; but to say why is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impossible. I hope I shall not bring upon myself the imputation of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ingratitude; but this imputation, more intolerable than any other, must
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be borne, if it cannot be avoided but by this disclosure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Keep your motives to yourself," said she. "I have too good an opinion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of you to suppose that you would practise concealment without good
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reason. I merely desire you to remain where you are. Since you will not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tell me why you take up this new scheme, I can only say that it is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impossible there should be any advantage in this scheme. I will not hear
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of it, I tell you. Therefore, submit to my decree with a good grace."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Notwithstanding this prohibition, I persisted in declaring that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,determination was fixed, and that the motives that governed me would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,allow of no alternative.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"So, you will go, will you, whether I will or no? I have no power to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,detain you? You will regard nothing that I can say?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Believe me, madam, no resolution ever was formed after a more vehement
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,struggle. If my motives were known, you would not only cease to oppose,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but would hasten, my departure. Honour me so far with your good opinion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as to believe that, in saying this, I say nothing but the truth, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,render my duty less burdensome by cheerfully acquiescing in its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dictates."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I would," replied the lady, "I could find somebody that has more power
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,over you than I have. Whom shall I call in to aid me in this arduous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,task?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Nay, dear madam, if I can resist your entreaties, surely no other can
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hope to succeed."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I am not sure of that," said my friend, archly; "there is one person in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the world whose supplications, I greatly suspect, you would not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,withstand."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Whom do you mean?" said I, in some trepidation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"You will know presently. Unless I can prevail upon you, I shall be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obliged to call for assistance."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Spare me the pain of repeating that no power on earth can change my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resolution."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"That's a fib," she rejoined, with increased archness. "You know it is.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,If a certain person entreat you to stay, you will easily comply. I see I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cannot hope to prevail by my own strength. That is a mortifying
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consideration: but we must not part; that is a point settled. If nothing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,else will do, I must go and fetch my advocate. Stay here a moment."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had scarcely time to breathe, before she returned, leading in Clarice.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I did not yet comprehend the meaning of this ceremony. The lady was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,overwhelmed with sweet confusion. Averted eyes and reluctant steps might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have explained to me the purpose of this meeting, if I had believed that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,purpose to be possible. I felt the necessity of new fortitude, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,struggled to recollect the motives that had hitherto sustained me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"There!" said my patroness; "I have been endeavouring to persuade this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,young man to live with us a little longer. He is determined, it seems,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to change his abode. He will not tell why, and I do not care to know,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unless I could show his reasons to be groundless. I have merely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remonstrated with him on the folly of his scheme, but he has proved
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,refractory to all I can say. Perhaps your efforts may meet with better
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,success."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clarice said not a word. My own embarrassment equally disabled me from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,speaking. Regarding us both, for some time, with a benign aspect, Mrs.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Lorimer resumed, taking a hand of each and joining them together:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I very well know what it was that suggested this scheme. It is strange
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that you should suppose me so careless an observer as not to note, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not to understand, your situation. I am as well acquainted with what is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passing in your heart as you yourself are: but why are you so anxious to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conceal it? You know less of the adventurousness of love than I should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have suspected. But I will not trifle with your feelings.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"You, Clithero, know the wishes that I once cherished. I had hoped that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my son would have found, in this darling child, an object worthy of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,choice, and that my girl would have preferred him to all others. But I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have long since discovered that this could not be. They are nowise
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suited to each other. There is one thing in the next place desirable,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and now my wishes are accomplished. I see that you love each other; and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,never, in my opinion, was a passion more rational and just. I should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,think myself the worst of beings if I did not contribute all in my power
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to your happiness. There is not the shadow of objection to your union. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,know your scruples, Clithero, and am sorry to see that you harbour them
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for a moment. Nothing is more unworthy of your good sense.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I found out this girl long ago. Take my word for it, young man, she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,does not fall short of you in the purity and tenderness of her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attachment. What need is there of tedious preliminaries? I will leave
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you together, and hope you will not be long in coming to a mutual
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,understanding. Your union cannot be completed too soon for my wishes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clarice is my only and darling daughter. As to you, Clithero, expect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,henceforth that treatment from me, not only to which your own merit
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entitles you, but which is due to the husband of my daughter."--With
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these words she retired, and left us together.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Great God! deliver me from the torments of this remembrance. That a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being by whom I was snatched from penury and brutal ignorance, exalted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to some rank in the intelligent creation, reared to affluence and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,honour, and thus, at last, spontaneously endowed with all that remained
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to complete the sum of my felicity, that a being like this-But such
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thoughts must not yet be: I must shut them out, or I shall never arrive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at the end of my tale. My efforts have been thus far successful. I have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hitherto been able to deliver a coherent narrative. Let the last words
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I shall speak afford some glimmering of my better days. Let me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,execute without faltering the only task that remains for me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter VI.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How propitious, how incredible, was this event! I could scarcely confide
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the testimony of my senses. Was it true that Clarice was before me,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that she was prepared to countenance my presumption, that she had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,slighted obstacles which I had deemed insurmountable, that I was fondly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beloved by her, and should shortly be admitted to the possession of so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inestimable a good? I will not repeat the terms in which I poured forth,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at her feet, the raptures of my gratitude. My impetuosity soon extorted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from Clarice a confirmation of her mother's declaration. An unrestrained
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intercourse was thenceforth established between us. Dejection and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,languor gave place, in my bosom, to the irradiations of joy and hope. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flowing fortunes seemed to have attained their utmost and immutable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,height.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Alas! They were destined to ebb with unspeakably-greater rapidity, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to leave me, in a moment, stranded and wrecked.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Our nuptials would have been solemnized without delay, had not a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,melancholy duty interfered. Clarice had a friend in a distant part of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the kingdom. Her health had long been the prey of a consumption. She was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now evidently tending to dissolution. In this extremity she entreated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her friend to afford her the consolation of her presence. The only wish
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that remained was to die in her arms.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This request could not but be willingly complied with. It became me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,patiently to endure the delay that would thence arise to the completion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my wishes. Considering the urgency and mournfulness of the occasion,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it was impossible for me to murmur, and the affectionate Clarice would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suffer nothing to interfere with the duty which she owed to her dying
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friend. I accompanied her on this journey, remained with her a few days,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and then parted from her to return to the metropolis. It was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imagined that it would be necessary to prolong her absence beyond a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,month. When I bade her farewell, and informed her on what day I proposed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to return for her, I felt no decay of my satisfaction. My thoughts were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bright and full of exultation. Why was not some intimation afforded me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the snares that lay in my path? In the train laid for my destruction,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the agent had so skilfully contrived that my security was not molested
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by the faintest omen.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I hasten to the crisis of my tale. I am almost dubious of my strength.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The nearer I approach to it, the stronger is my aversion. My courage,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instead of gathering force as I proceed, decays. I am willing to dwell
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,still longer on preliminary circumstances. There are other incidents
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without which my story would be lame. I retail them because they afford
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me a kind of respite from horrors at the thought of which every joint in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my frame trembles. They must be endured, but that infirmity may be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forgiven which makes me inclined to procrastinate my suffering.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I mentioned the lover whom my patroness was compelled, by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,machinations of her brother, to discard. More than twenty years had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passed since their separation. His birth was mean and he was without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortune. His profession was that of a surgeon. My lady not only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prevailed upon him to abandon his country, but enabled him to do this by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supplying his necessities from her own purse. His excellent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,understanding was, for a time, obscured by passion; but it was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,difficult for my lady ultimately to obtain his concurrence to all her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,schemes. He saw and adored the rectitude of her motives, did not disdain
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to accept her gifts, and projected means for maintaining an epistolary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intercourse during their separation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Her interest procured him a post in the service of the East India
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Company. She was, from time to time, informed of his motions. A war
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,broke out between the Company and some of the native powers. He was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,present at a great battle in which the English were defeated. She could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trace him by his letters and by other circumstances thus far, but here
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the thread was discontinued, and no means which she employed could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,procure any tidings of him. Whether he was captive, or dead, continued,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for several years, to be merely matter of conjecture.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On my return to Dublin, I found my patroness engaged in conversation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with a stranger. She introduced us to each other in a manner that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indicated the respect which she entertained for us both. I surveyed and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,listened to him with considerable attention. His aspect was noble and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ingenuous, but his sunburnt and rugged features bespoke a various and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,boisterous pilgrimage. The furrows of his brow were the products of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vicissitude and hardship, rather than of age. His accents were fiery and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,energetic, and the impassioned boldness of his address, as well as the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tenor of his discourse, full of allusions to the past, and regrets that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the course of events had not been different, made me suspect something
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extraordinary in his character.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As soon as he left us, my lady explained who he was. He was no other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,than the object of her youthful attachment, who had, a few days before,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dropped among us as from the skies. He had a long and various story to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tell. He had accounted for his silence by enumerating the incidents of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his life. He had escaped from the prisons of Hyder, had wandered on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,foot, and under various disguises, through the northern district of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Hindostan. He was sometimes a scholar of Benares, and sometimes a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disciple of the Mosque. According to the exigencies of the times, he was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a pilgrim to Mecca or to Juggernaut. By a long, circuitous, and perilous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,route, he at length arrived at the Turkish capital. Here he resided for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,several years, deriving a precarious subsistence from the profession of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a surgeon. He was obliged to desert this post, in consequence of a duel
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,between two Scotsmen. One of them had embraced the Greek religion, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was betrothed to the daughter of a wealthy trader of that nation. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perished in the conflict, and the family of the lady not only procured
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the execution of his antagonist, but threatened to involve all those who
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were known to be connected with him in the same ruin.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His life being thus endangered, it became necessary for him to seek a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,new residence. He fled from Constantinople with such precipitation as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reduced him to the lowest poverty. He had traversed the Indian conquests
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of Alexander, as a mendicant. In the same character, he now wandered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,over the native country of Philip and Philopoemen. He passed safely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,through multiplied perils, and finally, embarking at Salonica, he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reached Venice. He descended through the passes of the Apennines into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Tuscany. In this journey he suffered a long detention from banditti, by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom he was waylaid. In consequence of his harmless deportment, and a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seasonable display of his chirurgical skill, they granted him his life,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,though they, for a time, restrained him of his liberty, and compelled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him to endure their society. The time was not misemployed which he spent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,immured in caverns and carousing with robbers. His details were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eminently singular and curious, and evinced the acuteness of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,penetration, as well as the steadfastness of his courage.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,After emerging from these wilds, he found his way along the banks of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Arno to Leghorn. Thence he procured a passage to America, whence he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,just returned, with many additions to his experience, but none to his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortune.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This was a remarkable event. It did not at first appear how far its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequences would extend. The lady was, at present, disengaged and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,independent. Though the passion which clouded her early prosperity was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extinct, time had not diminished the worth of her friend, and they were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,far from having reached that age when love becomes chimerical and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,marriage folly. A confidential intercourse was immediately established
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,between them. The bounty of Mrs. Lorimer soon divested her friend of all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fear of poverty. "At any rate," said she, "he shall wander no farther,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but shall be comfortably situated for the rest of his life." All his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scruples were vanquished by the reasonableness of her remonstrances and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the vehemence of her solicitations.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A cordial intimacy grew between me and the newly-arrived. Our interviews
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were frequent, and our communications without reserve. He detailed to me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the result of his experience, and expatiated without end on the history
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his actions and opinions. He related the adventures of his youth, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dwelt upon all the circumstances of his attachment to my patroness. On
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this subject I had heard only general details. I continually found
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cause, in the course of his narrative, to revere the illustrious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,qualities of my lady, and to weep at the calamities to which the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,infernal malice of her brother had subjected her.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The tale of that man's misdeeds, amplified and dramatized by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indignant eloquence of this historian, oppressed me with astonishment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,If a poet had drawn such a portrait, I should have been prone to suspect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the soundness of his judgment. Till now I had imagined that no character
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was uniform and unmixed, and my theory of the passions did not enable me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to account for a propensity gratified merely by evil, and delighting in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shrieks and agony for their own sake.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was natural to suggest to my friend, when expatiating on this theme,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an inquiry as to how far subsequent events had obliterated the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impressions that were then made, and as to the plausibility of reviving,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at this more auspicious period, his claims on the heart of his friend.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,When he thought proper to notice these hints, he gave me to understand
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that time had made no essential alteration in his sentiments in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,respect; that he still fostered a hope, to which every day added new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vigour; that, whatever was the ultimate event, he trusted in his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortitude to sustain it, if adverse, and in his wisdom to extract from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it the most valuable consequences, if it should prove prosperous.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The progress of things was not unfavourable to his hopes. She treated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his insinuations and professions with levity; but her arguments seemed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to be urged with no other view than to afford an opportunity of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confutation; and, since there was no abatement of familiarity and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kindness, there was room to hope that the affair would terminate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,agreeably to his wishes.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clarice, meanwhile, was absent. Her friend seemed, at the end of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,month, to be little less distant from the grave than at first. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impatience would not allow me to wait till her death. I visited her, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was once more obliged to return alone. I arrived late in the city, and,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being greatly fatigued, I retired almost immediately to my chamber.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On hearing of my arrival, Sarsefield hastened to see me. He came to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bedside, and such, in his opinion, was the importance of the tidings
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which he had to communicate, that he did not scruple to rouse me from a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deep sleep----
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At this period of his narrative, Clithero stopped. His complexion varied
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from one degree of paleness to another. His brain appeared to suffer
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some severe constriction. He desired to be excused, for a few minutes,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from proceeding. In a short time he was relieved from this paroxysm, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resumed his tale with an accent tremulous at first, but acquiring
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stability and force as he went on:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On waking, as I have said, I found my friend seated at my bedside. His
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,countenance exhibited various tokens of alarm. As soon as I perceived
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who it was, I started, exclaiming, "What is the matter?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He sighed. "Pardon," said he, "this unseasonable intrusion. A light
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,matter would not have occasioned it. I have waited, for two days past,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in an agony of impatience, for your return. Happily you are, at last,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,come. I stand in the utmost need of your counsel and aid."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Heaven defend!" cried I. "This is a terrible prelude. You may, of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,course, rely upon my assistance and advice. What is it that you have to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,propose?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Tuesday evening," he answered, "I spent here. It was late before I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,returned to my lodgings. I was in the act of lifting my hand to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bell, when my eye was caught by a person standing close to the wall, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the distance of ten paces. His attitude was that of one employed in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,watching my motions. His face was turned towards me, and happened, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that moment, to be fully illuminated by the rays of a globe-lamp that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hung over the door. I instantly recognised his features. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,petrified. I had no power to execute my design, or even to move, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stood, for some seconds, gazing upon him. He was, in no degree,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disconcerted by the eagerness of my scrutiny. He seemed perfectly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indifferent to the consequences of being known. At length he slowly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,turned his eyes to another quarter, but without changing his posture, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the sternness of his looks. I cannot describe to you the shock which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this encounter produced in me. At last I went into the house, and have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ever since been excessively uneasy."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I do not see any ground for uneasiness."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"You do not then suspect who this person is?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"No."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"It is Arthur Wiatte."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Good heaven! It is impossible. What! my lady's brother?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The same."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"It cannot be. Were we not assured of his death? That he perished in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mutiny on board the vessel in which he was embarked for transportation?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Such was rumour, which is easily mistaken. My eyes cannot be deceived
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in this case. I should as easily fail to recognise his sister, when I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,first met her, as him. This is the man; whether once dead or not, he is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at present alive, and in this city."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"But has any thing since happened to confirm you in this opinion?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Yes, there has. As soon as I had recovered from my first surprise, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,began to reflect upon the measures proper to be taken. This was the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,identical Arthur Wiatte. You know his character. No time was likely to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,change the principles of such a man, but his appearance sufficiently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,betrayed the incurableness of his habits. The same sullen and atrocious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passions were written in his visage. You recollect the vengeance which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Wiatte denounced against his sister. There is every thing to dread from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his malignity. How to obviate the danger, I know not. I thought,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,however, of one expedient. It might serve a present purpose, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,something better might suggest itself on your return.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I came hither early the next day. Old Gowan, the porter, is well
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acquainted with Wiatte's story. I mentioned to him that I had reason to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,think that he had returned. I charged him to have a watchful eye upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,every one that knocked at the gate, and that, if this person should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,come, by no means to admit him. The old man promised faithfully to abide
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by my directions. His terrors, indeed, were greater than mine, and he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knew the importance of excluding Wiatte from these walls."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Did you not inform my lady of this?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"No. In what way could I tell it to her? What end could it answer? Why
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should I make her miserable? But I have not done. Yesterday morning
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Gowan took me aside, and informed me that Wiatte had made his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appearance, the day before, at the gate. He knew him, he said, in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moment. He demanded to see the lady, but the old man told him she was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,engaged, and could not be seen. He assumed peremptory and haughty airs,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and asserted that his business was of such importance as not to endure a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moment's delay. Gowan persisted in his first refusal. He retired with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,great reluctance, but said he should return to-morrow, when he should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,insist upon admission to the presence of the lady. I have inquired, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,find that he has not repeated his visit. What is to be done?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was equally at a loss with my friend. This incident was so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unlooked-for. What might not be dreaded from the monstrous depravity of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Wiatte? His menaces of vengeance against his sister still rung in my ears.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some means of eluding them were indispensable. Could law be resorted to?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Against an evil like this, no legal provision had been made. Nine years
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had elapsed since his transportation. Seven years was the period of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exile. In returning, therefore, he had committed no crime. His person
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could not be lawfully molested. We were justified merely in repelling an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attack. But suppose we should appeal to law: could this be done without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the knowledge and concurrence of the lady? She would never permit it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Her heart was incapable of fear from this quarter. She would spurn at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the mention of precautions against the hatred of her brother. Her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inquietude would merely be awakened on his own account.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was overwhelmed with perplexity. Perhaps if he were sought out, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some judgment formed of the kind of danger to be dreaded from him, by a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowledge of his situation and views, some expedient might be thence
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggested.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But how should his haunts be discovered? This was easy. He had intimated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the design of applying again for admission to his sister. Let a person
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be stationed near at hand, who, being furnished with an adequate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,description of his person and dress, shall mark him when he comes, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,follow him when he retires, and shall forthwith impart to us the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,information on that head which he shall be able to collect.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My friend concurred in this scheme. No better could, for the present, be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggested. Here ended our conference.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was thus supplied with a new subject of reflection. It was calculated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to fill my mind with dreary forebodings. The future was no longer a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scene of security and pleasure. It would be hard for those to partake of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,our fears who did not partake of our experience. The existence of Wiatte
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was the canker that had blasted the felicity of my patroness. In his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reappearance on the stage there was something portentous. It seemed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,include in it consequences of the utmost moment, without my being able
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to discover what these consequences were.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That Sarsefield should be so quickly followed by his arch-foe; that they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,started anew into existence, without any previous intimation, in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,manner wholly unexpected, and at the same period,--it seemed as if there
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lurked, under those appearances, a tremendous significance, which human
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sagacity could not uncover. My heart sunk within me when I reflected
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that this was the father of my Clarice. He by whose cruelty her mother
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was torn from the enjoyment of untarnished honour, and consigned to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,infamy and an untimely grave. He by whom herself was abandoned in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,helplessness of infancy, and left to be the prey of obdurate avarice,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the victim of wretches who traffic in virgin innocence. Who had done
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,all that in him lay to devote her youth to guilt and misery. What were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the limits of his power? How may he exert the parental prerogatives?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To sleep, while these images were haunting me, was impossible. I passed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the night in continual motion. I strode, without ceasing, across the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,floor of my apartment. My mind was wrought to a higher pitch than I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ever before experienced. The occasion, accurately considered, was far
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from justifying the ominous inquietudes which I then felt. How, then,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should I account for them?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield probably enjoyed his usual slumber. His repose might not be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perfectly serene, but when he ruminated on impending or possible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,calamities his tongue did not cleave to his mouth, his throat was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,parched with unquenchable thirst, he was not incessantly stimulated to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,employ his superfluous fertility of thought in motion. If I trembled for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the safety of her whom I loved, and whose safety was endangered by being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the daughter of this miscreant, had he not equal reason to fear for her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom he also loved, and who, as the sister of this ruffian, was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,encompassed by the most alarming perils? Yet he probably was calm while
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was harassed by anxieties.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Alas! The difference was easily explained. Such was the beginning of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,series ordained to hurry me to swift destruction. Such were the primary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tokens of the presence of that power by whose accursed machinations I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was destined to fall. You are startled at this declaration. It is one to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which you have been little accustomed. Perhaps you regard it merely as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an effusion of frenzy. I know what I am saying. I do not build upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conjectures and surmises. I care not, indeed, for your doubts. Your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conclusion may be fashioned at your pleasure. Would to Heaven that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,belief were groundless, and that I had no reason to believe my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intellects to have been perverted by diabolical instigations!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I could procure no sleep that night. After Sarsefield's departure I did
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not even lie down. It seemed to me that I could not obtain the benefits
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of repose otherwise than by placing my lady beyond the possibility of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,danger.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I met Sarsefield the next day. In pursuance of the scheme which had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,adopted by us on the preceding evening, a person was selected and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,commissioned to watch the appearance of Wiatte. The day passed as usual
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with respect to the lady. In the evening she was surrounded by a few
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friends. Into this number I was now admitted. Sarsefield and myself made
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a part of this company. Various topics were discussed with ease and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sprightliness. Her societies were composed of both sexes, and seemed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have monopolized all the ingenuity and wit that existed in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,metropolis.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,After a slight repast the company dispersed. This separation took place
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,earlier than usual, on account of a slight indisposition in Mrs.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,_Lorimer_. Sarsefield and I went out together. We took that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opportunity of examining our agent, and, receiving no satisfaction from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him, we dismissed him for that night, enjoining him to hold himself in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,readiness for repeating the experiment to-morrow. My friend directed his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steps homeward, and I proceeded to execute a commission with which I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,charged myself.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A few days before, a large sum had been deposited in the hands of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,banker, for the use of my lady. It was the amount of a debt which had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lately been recovered. It was lodged here for the purpose of being paid
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on demand of her or her agents. It was my present business to receive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this money. I had deferred the performance of this engagement to this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,late hour, on account of certain preliminaries which were necessary to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be adjusted.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Having received this money, I prepared to return home. The inquietude
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which had been occasioned by Sarsefield's intelligence had not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incapacitated me from performing my usual daily occupations. It was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,theme to which, at every interval of leisure from business or discourse,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I did not fail to return. At those times I employed myself in examining
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the subject on all sides; in supposing particular emergencies, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,delineating the conduct that was proper to be observed on each. My daily
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thoughts were, by no means, so fear-inspiring as the meditations of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,night had been.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As soon as I left the banker's door, my meditations fell into this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,channel. I again reviewed the recent occurrences, and imagined the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequences likely to flow from them. My deductions were not, on this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasion, peculiarly distressful. The return of darkness had added
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing to my apprehensions. I regarded Wiatte merely as one against
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whose malice it was wise to employ the most vigilant precautions. In
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,revolving these precautions nothing occurred that was new. The danger
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appeared without unusual aggravations, and the expedients that offered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,themselves to my choice were viewed with a temper not more sanguine or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,despondent than before.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In this state of mind I began and continued my walk. The distance was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,considerable between my own habitation and that which I had left. My way
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lay chiefly through populous and well-frequented streets. In one part of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the way, however, it was at the option of the passenger either to keep
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,along the large streets, or considerably to shorten the journey by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,turning into a dark, crooked, and narrow lane. Being familiar with every
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,part of this metropolis, and deeming it advisable to take the shortest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and obscurest road, I turned into the alley. I proceeded without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interruption to the next turning. One night-officer, distinguished by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his usual ensigns, was the only person who passed me. I had gone three
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steps beyond when I perceived a man by my side. I had scarcely time to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,notice this circumstance, when a hoarse voice exclaimed, "Damn ye,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,villain, ye're a dead man!"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At the same moment a pistol flashed at my ear, and a report followed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This, however, produced no other effect than, for a short space, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,overpower my senses. I staggered back, but did not fall.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The ball, as I afterwards discovered, had grazed my forehead, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without making any dangerous impression. The assassin, perceiving that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his pistol had been ineffectual, muttered, in an enraged tone, "This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shall do your business!" At the same time, he drew a knife forth from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his bosom.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was able to distinguish this action by the rays of a distant lamp,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which glistened on the blade. All this passed in an instant. The attack
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was so abrupt that my thoughts could not be suddenly recalled from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confusion into which they were thrown. My exertions were mechanical. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,will might be said to be passive, and it was only by retrospect and a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contemplation of consequences that I became fully informed of the nature
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the scene.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,If my assailant had disappeared as soon as he had discharged the pistol,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my state of extreme surprise might have slowly given place to resolution
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and activity. As it was, my sense was no sooner struck by the reflection
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the blade, than my hand, as if by spontaneous energy, was thrust
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into my pocket. I drew forth a pistol.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He lifted up his weapon to strike, but it dropped from his powerless
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fingers. He fell, and his groans informed me that I had managed my arms
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with more skill than my adversary. The noise of this encounter soon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attracted spectators. Lights were brought, and my antagonist discovered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bleeding at my feet. I explained, as briefly as I was able, the scene
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which they witnessed. The prostrate person was raised by two men, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,carried into a public house nigh at hand.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had not lost my presence of mind. I at once perceived the propriety of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,administering assistance to the wounded man. I despatched, therefore,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,one of the bystanders for a surgeon of considerable eminence, who lived
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at a small distance, and to whom I was well known. The man was carried
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into an inner apartment and laid upon the floor. It was not till now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I had a suitable opportunity of ascertaining who it was with whom I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been engaged. I now looked upon his face. The paleness of death
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could not conceal his well-known features. It was Wiatte himself who was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,breathing his last groans at my feet!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The surgeon, whom I had summoned, attended; but immediately perceived
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the condition of his patient to be hopeless. In a quarter of an hour he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expired. During this interval, he was insensible to all around him. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was known to the surgeon, the landlord, and some of the witnesses. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,case needed little explanation. The accident reflected no guilt upon me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The landlord was charged with the care of the corpse till the morning,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and I was allowed to return home, without further impediment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter VIII.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Till now my mind had been swayed by the urgencies of this occasion.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These reflections were excluded, which rushed tumultuously upon me the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moment I was at leisure to receive them. Without foresight of a previous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moment, an entire change had been wrought in my condition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had been oppressed with a sense of the danger that flowed from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,existence of this man. By what means the peril could be annihilated, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,we be placed in security from his attempts, no efforts of mind could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggest. To devise these means, and employ them with success, demanded,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as I conceived, the most powerful sagacity and the firmest courage. Now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the danger was no more. The intelligence in which plans of mischief
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might be generated was extinguished or flown. Lifeless were the hands
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ready to execute the dictates of that intelligence. The contriver of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enormous evil was, in one moment, bereft of the power and the will to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,injure. Our past tranquillity had been owing to the belief of his death.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Fear and dismay had resumed their dominion when the mistake was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovered. But now we might regain possession of our wonted confidence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had beheld with my own eyes the lifeless corpse of our implacable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,adversary. Thus, in a moment, had terminated his long and flagitious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,career. His restless indignation, his malignant projects, that had so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,long occupied the stage and been so fertile of calamity, were now at an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,end!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In the course of my meditations, the idea of the death of this man had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occurred, and it bore the appearance of a desirable event. Yet it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,little qualified to tranquillize my fears. In the long catalogue of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contingencies, this, indeed, was to be found; but it was as little
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,likely to happen as any other. It could not happen without a series of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,anterior events paving the way for it. If his death came from us, it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,must be the theme of design. It must spring from laborious circumvention
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and deep-laid stratagems.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,No. He was dead. I had killed him. What had I done? I had meditated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing. I was impelled by an unconscious necessity. Had the assailant
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been my father, the consequence would have been the same. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,understanding had been neutral. Could it be? In a space so short, was it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible that so tremendous a deed had been executed? Was I not deceived
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by some portentous vision? I had witnessed the convulsions and last
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,agonies of Wiatte. He was no more, and I was his destroyer!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Such was the state of my mind for some time after this dreadful event.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Previously to it I was calm, considerate, and self-collected. I marked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the way that I was going. Passing objects were observed. If I adverted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the series of my own reflections, my attention was not seized and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fastened by them. I could disengage myself at pleasure, and could pass,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without difficulty, from attention to the world within, to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contemplation of that without.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Now my liberty, in this respect, was at an end. I was fettered,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confounded, smitten with excess of thought, and laid prostrate with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wonder! I no longer attended to my steps. When I emerged from my stupor,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I found that I had trodden back the way which I had lately come, and had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arrived within sight of the banker's door. I checked myself, and once
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more turned my steps homeward.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This seemed to be a hint for entering into new reflections. "The deed,"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,said I, "is irretrievable. I have killed the brother of my patroness,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the father of my love."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This suggestion was new. It instantly involved me in terror and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perplexity. How shall I communicate the tidings? What effect will they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,produce? My lady's sagacity is obscured by the benevolence of her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,temper. Her brother was sordidly wicked,--a hoary ruffian, to whom the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,language of pity was as unintelligible as the gabble of monkeys. His
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heart was fortified against compunction, by the atrocious habits of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forty years; he lived only to interrupt her peace, to confute the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,promises of virtue, and convert to rancour and reproach the fair dame of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fidelity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He was her brother still. As a human being, his depravity was never
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beyond the health-restoring power of repentance. His heart, so long as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it beat, was accessible to remorse. The singularity of his birth had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made her regard this being as more intimately her brother, than would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have happened in different circumstances. It was her obstinate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,persuasion that their fates were blended. The rumour of his death she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had never credited. It was a topic of congratulation to her friends, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of mourning and distress to her. That he would one day reappear upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stage, and assume the dignity of virtue, was a source of consolation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with which she would never consent to part.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Her character was now known. When the doom of exile was pronounced upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him, she deemed it incumbent on her to vindicate herself from aspersions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,founded on misconceptions of her motives in refusing her interference.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The manuscript, though unpublished, was widely circulated. None could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resist her simple and touching eloquence, nor rise from the perusal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without resigning his heart to the most impetuous impulses of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,admiration, and enlisting himself among the eulogists of her justice and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her fortitude. This was the only monument, in a written form, of her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,genius. As such it was engraven on my memory. The picture that it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,described was the perpetual companion of my thoughts.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Alas! It had, perhaps, been well for me if it had been buried in eternal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,oblivion. I read in it the condemnation of my deed, the agonies she was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,preparing to suffer, and the indignation that would overflow upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,author of so signal a calamity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had rescued my life by the sacrifice of his. Whereas I should have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,died. Wretched and precipitate coward! What had become of my boasted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gratitude? Such was the zeal that I had vowed to her. Such the services
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which it was the business of my life to perform. I had snatched her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brother from existence. I had torn from her the hope which she so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ardently and indefatigably cherished. From a contemptible and dastardly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regard to my own safety I had failed in the moment of trial and when
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,called upon by Heaven to evince the sincerity of my professions.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She had treated my professions lightly. My vows of eternal devotion she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had rejected with lofty disinterestedness. She had arraigned my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impatience of obligation as criminal, and condemned every scheme I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,projected for freeing myself from the burden which her beneficence had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,laid upon me. The impassioned and vehement anxiety with which, in former
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,days, she had deprecated the vengeance of her lover against Wiatte, rung
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in my ears. My senses were shocked anew by the dreadful sounds, "Touch
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not my brother. Wherever you meet with him, of whatever outrage he be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guilty, suffer him to pass in safety. Despise me; abandon me; kill me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,All this I can bear even from you; but spare, I implore you, my unhappy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brother. The stroke that deprives him of life will not only have the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,same effect upon me, but will set my portion in everlasting misery."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To these supplications I had been deaf. It is true I had not rushed upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him unarmed, intending no injury nor expecting any. Of that degree of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wickedness I was, perhaps, incapable. Alas! I have immersed myself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficiently deep in crimes. I have trampled under foot every motive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dear to the heart of honour. I have shown myself unworthy the society of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,men.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Such were the turbulent suggestions of that moment. My pace slackened. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stopped, and was obliged to support myself against a wall. The sickness
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that had seized my heart penetrated every part of my frame. There was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but one thing wanting to complete my distraction.--"My lady," said I,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"believed her fate to be blended with that of Wiatte. Who shall affirm
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that the persuasion is a groundless one? She had lived and prospered,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,notwithstanding the general belief that her brother was dead. She would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not hearken to the rumour. Why? Because nothing less than indubitable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,evidence would suffice to convince her? Because the counter-intimation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flowed from an infallible source? How can the latter supposition be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confuted? Has she not predicted the event?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The period of terrible fulfilment has arrived. The same blow that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bereaved _him_ of life has likewise ratified her doom.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"She has been deceived. It is nothing more, perhaps, than a fond
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imagination. It matters not. Who knows not the cogency of faith? That
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the pulses of life are at the command of the will? The bearer of these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tidings will be the messenger of death. A fatal sympathy will seize her.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She will shrink, and swoon, and perish, at the news!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Fond and short-sighted wretch! This is the price thou hast given for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,security. In the rashness of thy thought, thou saidst, 'Nothing is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wanting but his death to restore us to confidence and safety.' Lo! the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,purchase is made. Havoc and despair, that were restrained during his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life, were let loose by his last sigh. Now only is destruction made
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sure. Thy lady, thy Clarice, thy friend, and thyself, are, by this act,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,involved in irretrievable and common ruin!"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I started from my attitude. I was scarcely conscious of any transition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The interval was fraught with stupor, and amazement. It seemed as if my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,senses had been hushed in sleep, while the powers of locomotion were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unconsciously exerted to bear me to my chamber. By whatever means the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,change was effected, there I was.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I have been able to proceed thus far. I can scarcely believe the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,testimony of my memory that assures me of this. My task is almost
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,executed; but whence shall I obtain strength enough to finish it? What I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have told is light as gossamer, compared with the insupportable and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,crushing horrors of that which is to come. Heaven, in token of its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vengeance, will enable me to proceed. It is fitting that my scene should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thus close.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My fancy began to be infected with the errors of my understanding. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mood into which my mind was plunged was incapable of any propitious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intermission. All within me was tempestuous and dark. My ears were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accessible to no sounds but those of shrieks and lamentations. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deepest midnight, and all the noises of a great metropolis were hushed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Yet I listened as if to catch some strain of the dirge that was begun.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sable robes, sobs, and a dreary solemnity encompassed me on all sides, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was haunted to despair by images of death, imaginary clamours, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,train of funeral pageantry. I seemed to have passed forward to a distant
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,era of my life. The effects which were come were already realized. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,foresight of misery created it, and set me in the midst of that hell
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I feared.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,From a paroxysm like this the worst might reasonably be dreaded, yet the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,next step to destruction was not suddenly taken. I paused on the brink
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the precipice, as if to survey the depth of that frenzy that invaded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me; was able to ponder on the scene, and deliberate, in a state that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,partook of calm, on the circumstances of my situation. My mind was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,harassed by the repetition of one idea. Conjecture deepened into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,certainty. I could place the object in no light which did not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,corroborate the persuasion that, in the act committed, I had insured the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destruction of my lady. At length my mind, somewhat relieved from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tempest of my fears, began to trace and analyze the consequences which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dreaded.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The fate of Wiatte would inevitably draw along with it that of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sister. In what way would this effect be produced? Were they linked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,together by a sympathy whose influence was independent of sensible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,communication? Could she arrive at a knowledge of his miserable and by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,other than verbal means? I had heard of such extraordinary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,copartnerships in being and modes of instantaneous intercourse among
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beings locally distant. Was this a new instance of the subtlety of mind?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Had she already endured his agonies, and like him already ceased to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,breathe?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Every hair bristled at this horrible suggestion. But the force of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sympathy might be chimerical. Buried in sleep, or engaged in careless
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,meditation, the instrument by which her destiny might be accomplished
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was the steel of an assassin. A series of events, equally beyond the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reach of foresight with those which had just happened, might introduce,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with equal abruptness, a similar disaster. What, at that moment, was her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,condition? Reposing in safety in her chamber, as her family imagined.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But were they not deceived? Was she not a mangled corpse? Whatever were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her situation, it could not be ascertained, except by extraordinary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means, till the morning. Was it wise to defer the scrutiny till then?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Why not instantly investigate the truth?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These ideas passed rapidly through my mind. A considerable portion of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time and amplification of phrase are necessary to exhibit, verbally,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ideas contemplated in a space of incalculable brevity. With the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rapidity I conceived the resolution of determining the truth of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspicions. All the family, but myself, were at rest. Winding passages
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would conduct me, without danger of disturbing them, to the hall, from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which double staircases ascended. One of these led to a saloon above, on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the east side of which was a door that communicated with a suite of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rooms occupied by the lady of the mansion. The first was an antechamber,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in which a female servant usually lay. The second was the lady's own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bedchamber. This was a sacred recess, with whose situation, relative to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the other apartments of the building, I was well acquainted, but of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I knew nothing from my own examination, having never been admitted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thither I was now resolved to repair. I was not deterred by the sanctity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the place and hour. I was insensible to all consequences but the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,removal of my doubts. Not that my hopes were balanced by my fears. That
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the same tragedy had been performed in her chamber and in the street,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing hindered me from believing with as much cogency as if my own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eyes had witnessed it, but the reluctance with which we admit a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,detestable truth.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To terminate a state of intolerable suspense, I resolved to proceed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forthwith to her chamber. I took the light and paced, with no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interruption, along the galleries. I used no precaution. If I had met a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,servant or robber, I am not sure that I should have noticed him. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attention was too perfectly engrossed to allow me to spare any to a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,casual object. I cannot affirm that no one observed me. This, however,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was probable from the distribution of the dwelling. It consisted of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,central edifice and two wings, one of which was appropriated to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,domestics and the other, at the extremity of which my apartment was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,placed, comprehended a library, and rooms for formal and social and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,literary conferences. These, therefore, were deserted at night, and my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,way lay along these. Hence it was not likely that my steps would be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,observed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I proceeded to the hall. The principal parlour was beneath her chamber.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In the confusion of my thoughts, I mistook one for the other. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rectified, as soon as I detected, my mistake. I ascended, with a beating
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heart, the staircase. The door of the antechamber was unfastened. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entered, totally regardless of disturbing the girl who slept within. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bed which she occupied was concealed by curtains. Whether she were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,there, I did not stop to examine. I cannot recollect that any tokens
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were given of wakefulness or alarm. It was not till I reached the door
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her own apartment that my heart began to falter.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was now that the momentousness of the question I was about to decide
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rushed with its genuine force upon my apprehension. Appalled and aghast,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had scarcely power to move the bolt. If the imagination of her death
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was not to be supported, how should I bear the spectacle of wounds and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,blood? Yet this was reserved for me. A few paces would set me in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,midst of a scene of which I was the abhorred contriver. Was it right to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,proceed? There were still the remnants of doubt. My forebodings might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possibly be groundless. All within might be safety and serenity. A
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,respite might be gained from the execution of an irrevocable sentence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What could I do? Was not any thing easy to endure in comparison with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,agonies of suspense? If I could not obviate the evil I must bear it, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the torments of suspense were susceptible of remedy.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I drew back the bolt, and entered with the reluctance of fear, rather
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,than the cautiousness of guilt. I could not lift my eyes from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ground. I advanced to the middle of the room. Not a sound like that of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the dying saluted my-ear. At length, shaking off the fetters of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hopelessness, I looked up.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I saw nothing calculated to confirm my fears. Everywhere there reigned
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quiet and order. My heart leaped with exultation. "Can it be," said I,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"that I have been betrayed with shadows?--But this is not sufficient."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Within an alcove was the bed that belonged to her. If her safety were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inviolate, it was here that she reposed. What remained to convert
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tormenting doubt into ravishing certainty? I was insensible to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perils of my present situation. If she, indeed, were there, would not my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intrusion awaken her? She would start and perceive me, at this hour,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,standing at her bedside. How should I account for an intrusion so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unexampled and audacious? I could not communicate my fears. I could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tell her that the blood with which my hands were stained had flowed from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the wounds of her brother.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My mind was inaccessible to such considerations. They did not even
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,modify my predominant idea. Obstacles like these, had they existed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would have been trampled under foot.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Leaving the lamp, that I bore, on the table, I approached the bed. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,slowly drew aside the curtain, and beheld her tranquilly slumbering. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,listened, but so profound was her sleep, that not even her breathings
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could be overheard. I dropped the curtain and retired.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How blissful and mild were the illuminations of my bosom at this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovery! A joy that surpassed all utterance succeeded the fierceness
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of desperation. I stood, for some moments, wrapped in delightful
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contemplation. Alas! it was a luminous but transient interval. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,madness to whose black suggestions it bore so strong a contrast began
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now to make sensible approaches on my understanding.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"True," said I, "she lives. Her slumber is serene and happy. She is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,blind to her approaching destiny. Some hours will at least be rescued
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from anguish and death. When she wakes, the phantom that soothed her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,will vanish. The tidings cannot be withheld from her. The murderer of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thy brother cannot hope to enjoy thy smiles. Those ravishing accents,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with which thou hast used to greet me, will be changed. Scowling and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reproaches, the invectives of thy anger and the maledictions of thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,justice, will rest upon my head,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What is the blessing which I made the theme of my boastful arrogance?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This interval of being and repose is momentary. She will awake, but only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to perish at the spectacle of my ingratitude. She will awake only to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consciousness of instantly-impending death. When she again sleeps she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,will wake no more. I, her son,--I, whom the law of my birth doomed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,poverty and hardship, but whom her unsolicited beneficence snatched from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,those evils, and endowed with the highest good known to intelligent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beings, the consolations of science and the blandishments of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,affluence,--to whom the darling of her life, the offspring in whom are
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,faithfully preserved the lineaments of its angelic mother, she has not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,denied! What is the recompense that I have made? How have I discharged
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the measureless debt of gratitude to which she is entitled? Thus!--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Cannot my guilt be extenuated? Is there not a good that I can do thee?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Must I perpetrate unmingled evil? Is the province assigned me that of an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,infernal emissary, whose efforts are concentred in a single purpose, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that purpose a malignant one? I am the author of thy calamities.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Whatever misery is reserved for thee, I am the source whence it flows.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Can I not set bounds to the stream? Cannot I prevent thee from returning
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to a consciousness which, till it ceases to exist, will not cease to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rent and mangled?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Yes. It is in my power to screen thee from the coming storm; to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accelerate thy journey to rest. I will do it."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The impulse was not to be resisted. I moved with the suddenness of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lightning. Armed with a pointed implement that lay----it was a dagger.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As I set down the lamp, I struck the edge. Yet I saw it not, or noticed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it not till I needed its assistance. By what accident it came hither, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,what deed of darkness it had already been subservient, I had no power to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inquire. I stepped to the table and seized it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The time which this action required was insufficient to save me. My doom
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was ratified by powers which no human energies can counterwork.--Need I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,go further? Did you entertain any imagination of so frightful a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,catastrophe? I am overwhelmed by turns with dismay and with wonder. I am
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prompted by turns to tear my heart from my breast and deny faith to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,verdict of my senses.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Was it I that hurried to the deed? No. It was the demon that possessed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me. My limbs were guided to the bloody office by a power foreign and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,superior to mine. I had been defrauded, for a moment, of the empire of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my muscles. A little moment for that sufficed.  If my destruction had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not been decreed, why was the image of Clarice so long excluded? Yet why
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,do I say long? The fatal resolution was conceived, and I hastened to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,execution, in a period too brief for more than itself to be viewed by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the intellect.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What then? Were my hands imbrued in this precious blood? Was it to this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extremity of horror that my evil genius was determined to urge me? Too
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surely this was his purpose; too surely I was qualified to be its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,minister.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I lifted the weapon. Its point was aimed at the bosom of the sleeper.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The impulse was given.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At the instant a piercing shriek was uttered behind me, and a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stretched-out hand, grasping the blade, made it swerve widely from its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,aim. It descended, but without inflicting a wound. Its force was spent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon the bed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Oh for words to paint that stormy transition! I loosed my hold of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dagger. I started back, and fixed eyes of frantic curiosity on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,author of my rescue. He that interposed to arrest my deed, that started
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into being and activity at a moment so pregnant with fate, without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tokens of his purpose or his coming being previously imparted, could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not, methought, be less than divinity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The first glance that I darted on this being corroborated my conjecture.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was the figure and lineaments of Mrs. Lorimer. Negligently habited in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flowing and brilliant white, with features bursting with terror and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wonder, the likeness of that being who was stretched upon the bed now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stood before me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,All that I am able to conceive of angel was comprised in the moral
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,constitution of this woman. That her genius had overleaped all bounds,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and interposed to save her, was no audacious imagination. In the state
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in which my mind then was, no other belief than this could occupy the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,first place.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My tongue was tied. I gazed by turns upon her who stood before me, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her who lay upon the bed, and who, awakened by the shriek that had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uttered, now opened her eyes. She started from her pillow, and, by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assuming a new and more distinct attitude, permitted me to recognise
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,_Clarice herself_!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Three days before, I had left her, beside the bed of a dying friend, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a solitary mansion in the mountains of Donegal. Here it had been her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resolution to remain till her friend should breathe her last. Fraught
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with this persuasion, knowing this to be the place and hour of repose of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my lady, hurried forward by the impetuosity of my own conceptions,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deceived by the faint gleam which penetrated through the curtain and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imperfectly-irradiated features which bore, at all times, a powerful
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resemblance to those of Mrs. Lorimer, I had rushed to the brink of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,terrible precipice!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Why did I linger on the verge? Why, thus perilously situated, did I not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,throw myself headlong? The steel was yet in my hand. A single blow would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have pierced my heart, and shut out from my remembrance and foresight
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the past and the future.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The moment of insanity had gone by, and I was once more myself. Instead
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of regarding the act which I had meditated as the dictate of compassion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or of justice, it only added to the sum of my ingratitude, and gave
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wings to the whirlwind that was sent to bear me to perdition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Perhaps I was influenced by a sentiment which I had not leisure to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distribute into parts. My understanding was, no doubt, bewildered in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maze of consequences which would spring from my act. How should I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,explain my coming hither in this murderous guise, my arm lifted to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destroy the idol of my soul and the darling child of my patroness? In
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,what words should I unfold the tale of Wiatte, and enumerate the motives
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that terminated in the present scene? What penalty had not my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,infatuation and cruelty deserved? What could I less than turn the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dagger's point against my own bosom?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A second time, the blow was thwarted and diverted. Once more this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beneficent interposer held my arm from the perpetration of a new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,iniquity. Once more frustrated the instigations of that demon, of whose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,malice a mysterious destiny had consigned me to be the sport and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prey.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Every new moment added to the sum of my inexpiable guilt. Murder was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,succeeded, in an instant, by the more detestable enormity of suicide.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She to whom my ingratitude was flagrant in proportion to the benefits of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which she was the author, had now added to her former acts that of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rescuing me from the last of mischiefs.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I threw the weapon on the floor. The zeal which prompted her to seize my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arm, this action occasioned to subside, and to yield place to those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,emotions which this spectacle was calculated to excite. She watched me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in silence, and with an air of ineffable solicitude. Clarice, governed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by the instinct of modesty, wrapped her bosom and face in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bedclothes, and testified her horror by vehement but scarcely-articulate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exclamations.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I moved forward, but my steps were random and tottering. My thoughts
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were fettered by reverie, and my gesticulations destitute of meaning. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tongue faltered without speaking, and I felt as if life and death were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,struggling within me for the mastery.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My will, indeed, was far from being neutral in this contest. To such as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I, annihilation is the supreme good. To shake off the ills that fasten
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on us by shaking off existence, is a lot which the system of nature has
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,denied to man. By escaping from life, I should be delivered from this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scene, but should only rush into a world of retribution, and be immersed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in new agonies.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was yet to live. No instrument of my deliverance was within reach. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was powerless. To rush from the presence of these women to hide me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forever from their scrutiny and their upbraiding, to snatch from their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,minds all traces of the existence of Clithero, was the scope of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unutterable longings.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Urged to flight by every motive of which my nature was susceptible, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was yet rooted to the spot. Had the pause been only to be interrupted by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me, it would have lasted forever.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At length, the lady, clasping her hands and lifting them, exclaimed, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a tone melting into pity and grief,--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Clithero! what is this? How came you hither, and why?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I struggled for utterance:--"I came to murder you. Your brother has
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perished by my hands. Fresh from the commission of this deed, I have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hastened hither to perpetrate the same crime upon you."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My brother!" replied the lady, with new vehemence. "Oh, say not so! I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have just heard of his return, from Sarsefield, and that he lives."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"He is dead," repeated I, with fierceness; "I know it. It was I that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,killed him."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Dead!" she faintly articulated. "And by thee, Clithero? Oh! cursed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chance that hindered thee from killing me also! Dead! Then is the omen
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fulfilled! Then am I undone! Lost forever!"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Her eyes now wandered from me, and her countenance sunk into a wild and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rueful expression. Hope was utterly extinguished in her heart, and life
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forsook her at the same moment. She sunk upon the floor pallid and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,breathless.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How she came into possession of this knowledge I know not. It is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible that Sarsefield had repented of concealment, and, in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interval that passed between our separation and my encounter with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Wiatte, had returned, and informed her of the reappearance of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,miscreant.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus, then, was my fate consummated. I was rescued from destroying her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by a dagger, only to behold her perish by the tidings which I brought.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus was every omen of mischief and misery fulfilled. Thus was the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enmity of Wiatte rendered efficacious, and the instrument of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destruction changed into the executioner of his revenge.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Such is the tale of my crimes. It is not for me to hope that the curtain
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of oblivion will ever shut out the dismal spectacle. It will haunt me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forever. The torments that grow out of it can terminate only with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thread of my existence, but that, I know full well, will never end.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Death is but a shifting of the scene; and the endless progress of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eternity, which to the good is merely the perfection of felicity, is to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the wicked an accumulation of woe. The self-destroyer is his own enemy:
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this has ever been my opinion. Hitherto it has influenced my actions.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Now, though the belief continues, its influence on my conduct is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,annihilated. I am no stranger to the depth of that abyss into which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shall plunge. No matter. Change is precious for its own sake.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Well, I was still to live. My abode must be somewhere fixed. My conduct
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was henceforth the result of a perverse and rebellious principle. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,banished myself forever from my native soil. I vowed never more to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,behold the face of my Clarice, to abandon my friends, my books, all my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wonted labours and accustomed recreations.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was neither ashamed nor afraid. I considered not in what way the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,justice of the country would affect me. It merely made no part of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contemplations. I was not embarrassed by the choice of expedients for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trammelling up the visible consequences and for eluding suspicion. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,idea of abjuring my country and flying forever from the hateful scene
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,partook, to my apprehension, of the vast, the boundless, and strange; of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plunging from the height of fortune to obscurity and indigence,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,corresponded with my present state of mind. It was of a piece with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tremendous and wonderful events that had just happened.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These were the images that haunted me, while I stood speechlessly gazing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at the ruin before me. I heard a noise from without, or imagined that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heard it. My reverie was broken, and my muscular power restored. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,descended into the street, through doors of which I possessed one set of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,keys, and hurried by the shortest way beyond the precincts of the city.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had laid no plan. My conceptions with regard to the future were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shapeless and confused. Successive incidents supplied me with a clue,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and suggested, as they rose, the next step to be taken. I threw off the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,garb of affluence, and assumed a beggar's attire. That I had money about
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me for the accomplishment of my purposes was wholly accidental. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,travelled along the coast, and, when I arrived at one town, knew not why
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I should go farther; but my restlessness was unabated, and change was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some relief. I it length arrived at Belfast. A vessel was preparing for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,America. I embraced eagerly the opportunity of passing into a new world.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I arrived at Philadelphia. As soon as I landed I wandered hither, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was content to wear out my few remaining days in the service of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Inglefield.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I have no friends. Why should I trust my story to mother? I have no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solicitude about concealment; but who is there who will derive pleasure
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or benefit from my rehearsal? And why should I expatiate on so hateful a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scheme? Yet now have I consented to this. I have confided in you the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,history of my disasters. I am not fearful of the use that you may be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disposed to make of it. I shall quickly set myself beyond the reach of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,human tribunals. I shall relieve the ministers of law from the trouble
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of punishing. The recent events which induced you to summon me to this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conference have likewise determined me to make this disclosure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was not aware, for some time, of my perturbed sleep. No wonder that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sleep cannot soothe miseries like mine; that I am alike infested by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,memory in wakefulness and slumber. Yet I was anew distressed by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovery that my thoughts found their way to my lips, without my being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conscious of it, and that my steps wandered forth unknowingly and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without the guidance of my will.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The story you have told is not incredible. The disaster to which you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,allude did not fail to excite my regret. I can still weep over the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,untimely fall of youth and worth. I can no otherwise account for my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,frequenting his shade than by the distant resemblance which the death of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this man bore to that of which I was the perpetrator. This resemblance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occurred to me at first. If he were able to weaken the impression which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was produced by my crime, this similitude was adapted to revive and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enforce them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The wilderness, and the cave to which you followed me, were familiar to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my Sunday rambles. Often have I indulged in audible griefs on the cliffs
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of that valley. Often have I brooded over my sorrows in the recesses of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that cavern. This scene is adapted to my temper. Its mountainous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,asperities supply me with images of desolation and seclusion, and its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,headlong streams lull me into temporary forgetfulness of mankind.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I comprehend you. You suspect me of concern in the death of Waldegrave.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You could not do otherwise. The conduct that you have witnessed was that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of a murderer. I will not upbraid you for your suspicions, though I have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bought exemption from them at a high price.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter IX.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There ended his narrative. He started from the spot where he stood, and,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without affording me any opportunity of replying or commenting,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappeared amidst the thickest of the wood. I had no time to exert
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,myself for his detention. I could have used no arguments for this end,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to which it is probable he would have listened. The story I had heard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was too extraordinary, too completely the reverse of all my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expectations, to allow me to attend to the intimations of self-murder
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which he dropped.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The secret which I imagined was about to be disclosed was as inscrutable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as ever. Not a circumstance, from the moment when Clithero's character
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,became the subject of my meditations, till the conclusion of his talk,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but served to confirm my suspicion. Was this error to be imputed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,credulity. Would not any one, from similar appearances, have drawn
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,similar conclusions? Or is there a criterion by which truth can always
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be distinguished? Was it owing to my imperfect education that the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inquietudes of this man were not traced to a deed performed at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance of a thousand leagues, to the murder of his patroness and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friend?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had heard a tale which apparently related to scenes and persons far
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distant: but, though my suspicions have appeared to have been misplaced,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,what should hinder but that the death of my friend was, in like manner,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an act of momentary insanity and originated in a like spirit of mistaken
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benevolence?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But I did not consider this tale merely in relation to myself. My life
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been limited and uniform. I had communed with romancers and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,historians, but the impression made upon me by this incident was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unexampled in my experience. My reading had furnished me with no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instance in any degree parallel to this, and I found that to be a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distant and second-hand spectator of events was widely different from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,witnessing them myself and partaking in their consequences. My judgment
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was, for a time, sunk into imbecility and confusion. My mind was full of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the images unavoidably suggested by this tale, but they existed in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kind of chaos, and not otherwise than gradually was I able to reduce
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them to distinct particulars, and subject them to a deliberate and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,methodical inspection.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How was I to consider this act of Clithero? What a deplorable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,infatuation! Yet it was the necessary result of a series of ideas
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mutually linked and connected. His conduct was dictated by a motive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,allied to virtue. It was the fruit of an ardent and grateful spirit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The death of Wiatte could not be censured. The life of Clithero was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unspeakably more valuable than that of his antagonist. It was the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instinct of self-preservation that swayed him. He knew not his adversary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in time enough to govern himself by that knowledge. Had the assailant
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been an unknown ruffian, his death would have been followed by no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remorse. The spectacle of his dying agonies would have dwelt upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,memory of his assassin like any other mournful sight, in the production
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of which he bore no part.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It must at least be said that his will was not concerned in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,transaction. He acted in obedience to an impulse which he could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,control nor resist. Shall we impute guilt where there is no design?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Shall a man extract food for self-reproach from an action to which it is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not enough to say that he was actuated by no culpable intention, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that he was swayed by no intention whatever? If consequences arise that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cannot be foreseen, shall we find no refuge in the persuasion of our
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rectitude and of human frailty? Shall we deem ourselves criminal because
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,we do not enjoy the attributes of Deity? Because our power and our
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowledge are confined by impassable boundaries?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But whence arose the subsequent intention? It was the fruit of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dreadful mistake. His intents were noble and compassionate. But this is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of no avail to free him from the imputation of guilt. No remembrance of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,past beneficence can compensate for this crime. The scale loaded with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the recriminations of his conscience, is immovable by any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,counter-weight.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But what are the conclusions to be drawn by dispassionate observers? Is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it possible to regard this person with disdain or with enmity? The crime
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,originated in those limitations which nature has imposed upon human
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,faculties. Proofs of a just intention are all that are requisite to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exempt us from blame; he is thus, in consequence of a double mistake.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The light in which he views this event is erroneous. He judges wrong,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and is therefore miserable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How imperfect are the grounds of all our decisions Was it of no use to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,superintend his childhood, to select his instructors and examples, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mark the operations of his principles, to see him emerging into youth,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to follow him through various scenes and trying vicissitudes, and mark
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the uniformity of his integrity? Who would have predicted his future
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conduct? Who would not have affirmed the impossibility of an action like
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How mysterious was the connection between the fate of Wiatte and his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sister! By such circuitous and yet infallible means were the prediction
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the lady and the vengeance of the brother accomplished! In how many
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cases may it be said, as in this, that the prediction was the cause of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,its own fulfilment! That the very act which considerate observers, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,even himself, for a time, imagined to have utterly precluded the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,execution of Wiatte's menaces, should be that inevitably leading to it!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That the execution should be assigned to him who, abounding in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,abhorrence, and in the act of self-defence, was the slayer of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,menacer!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As the obstructer of his designs, Wiatte waylaid and assaulted Clithero.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He perished in the attempt. Were his designs frustrated? No. It was thus
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that he secured the gratification of his vengeance. His sister was cut
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,off in the bloom of life and prosperity. By a refinement of good
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortune, the voluntary minister of his malice had entailed upon himself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exile without reprieve and misery without end.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But what chiefly excited my wonder was the connection of this tale with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the destiny of Sarsefield. This was he whom I have frequently mentioned
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to you as my preceptor. About four years previous to this era, he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appeared in this district without fortune or friend. He desired, one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,evening, to be accommodated at my uncle's house. The conversation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,turning on the objects of his journey and his present situation, he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,professed himself in search of lucrative employment. My uncle proposed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to him to become a teacher, there being a sufficient number of young
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,people in this neighbourhood to afford him occupation and subsistence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He found it his interest to embrace this proposal.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I, of course, became his pupil, and demeaned myself in such a manner as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,speedily to grow into a favourite. He communicated to us no part of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,early history, but informed us sufficiently of his adventures in Asia
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and Italy to make it plain that this was the same person alluded to by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero. During his abode among us his conduct was irreproachable. When
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he left us, he manifested the most poignant regret, but this originated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chiefly in his regard to me. He promised to maintain with me an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,epistolary intercourse. Since his departure, however, I had heard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing respecting him. It was with unspeakable regret that I now heard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the disappointment of his hopes, and was inquisitive respecting the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,measures which he would adopt in his new situation. Perhaps he would'
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,once more return to America, and I should again be admitted to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enjoyment of his society. This event I anticipated with the highest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,satisfaction.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At present, the fate of the unhappy Clithero was the subject of abundant
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,anxiety. On his suddenly leaving me, at the conclusion of his tale, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supposed that he had gone upon one of his usual rambles, and that it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would terminate only with the day. Next morning a message was received
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from Inglefield, inquiring if any one knew what had become of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,servant. I could not listen to this message with tranquillity, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recollected the hints that he had given of some design upon his life,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and admitted the most dreary forebodings. I speeded to Inglefield's.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero had not returned, they told me, the preceding evening. He had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not apprized them of any intention to change his abode. His boxes, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,all that composed his slender property, were found in their ordinary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,state. He had expressed no dissatisfaction with his present condition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Several days passed, and no tidings could be procured of him. His
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,absence was a topic of general speculation, but was a source of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,particular anxiety to no one but myself. My apprehensions were surely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,built upon sufficient grounds. From the moment that we parted, no one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had seen or heard of him. What mode of suicide he had selected, he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disabled us from discovering, by the impenetrable secrecy in which he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had involved it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In the midst of my reflections upon this subject, the idea of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wilderness occurred. Could he have executed his design in the deepest of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,its recesses? These were unvisited by human footsteps, and his bones
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might lie for ages in this solitude without attracting observation. To
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seek them where they lay, to gather them together and provide for them a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grave, was a duty which appeared incumbent on me, and of which the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,performance was connected with a thousand habitual sentiments and mixed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pleasures.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thou knowest my devotion to the spirit that breathes its inspiration in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the gloom of forests and on the verge of streams. I love to immerse
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,myself in shades and dells, and hold converse with the solemnities and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,secrecies of nature in the rude retreats of Norwalk. The disappearance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of Clithero had furnished new incitements to ascend its cliffs and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pervade its thickets, as I cherished the hope of meeting in my rambles
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with some traces of this man. But might he not still live? His words had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imparted the belief that he intended to destroy himself. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,catastrophe, however, was far from certain. Was it not in my power to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,avert it? Could I not restore a mind thus vigorous, to tranquil and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wholesome existence? Could I not subdue his perverse disdain and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,immeasurable abhorrence of himself? His upbraiding and his scorn were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unmerited and misplaced. Perhaps they argued frenzy rather than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prejudice; but frenzy, like prejudice, was curable. Reason was no less
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an antidote to the illusions of insanity like his, than to the illusions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of error.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I did not immediately recollect that to subsist in this desert was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impossible. Nuts were the only fruits it produced, and these were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inadequate to sustain human life. If it were haunted by Clithero, he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,must occasionally pass its limits and beg or purloin victuals. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deportment was too humiliating and flagitious to be imputed to him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was reason to suppose him smitten with the charms of solitude, of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a lonely abode in the midst of mountainous and rugged nature; but this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could not be uninterruptedly enjoyed. Life could be supported only by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasionally visiting the haunts of men, in the guise of a thief or a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mendicant. Hence, since Clithero was not known to have reappeared at any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,farm-house in the neighbourhood, I was compelled to conclude either that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he had retired far from this district, or that he was dead.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Though I designed that my leisure should chiefly be consumed in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bosom of Norwalk, I almost dismissed the hope of meeting with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fugitive. There were indeed two sources of my hopelessness on this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasion. Not only it was probable that Clithero had fled far away, but,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should he have concealed himself in some nook or cavern within these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precincts, his concealment was not to be traced. This arose from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nature of that sterile region.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It would not be easy to describe the face of this district, in a few
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,words. Half of Solesbury, thou knowest, admits neither of plough nor
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spade. The cultivable space lies along the river, and the desert, lying
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on the north, has gained, by some means, the appellation of Norwalk.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Canst thou imagine a space, somewhat circular, about six miles in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,diameter, and exhibiting a perpetual and intricate variety of craggy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eminences and deep dells?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The hollows are single, and walled around by cliffs, ever varying in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shape and height, and have seldom any perceptible communication with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,each other. These hollows are of all dimensions, from the narrowness and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depth of a well, to the amplitude of one hundred yards. Winter's snow is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,frequently found in these cavities at midsummer. The streams that burst
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forth from every crevice are thrown, by the irregularities of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surface, into numberless cascades, often disappear in mists or in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chasms, and emerge from subterranean channels, and, finally, either
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subside into lakes, or quietly meander through the lower and more level
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grounds.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Wherever nature left a flat it is made rugged and scarcely passable by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enormous and fallen trunks, accumulated by the storms of ages, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forming, by their slow decay, a moss-covered soil, the haunt of rabbits
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and lizards. These spots are obscured by the melancholy umbrage of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pines, whose eternal murmurs are in unison with vacancy and solitude,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with the reverberations of the torrents and the whistling of the blasts.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Hickory and poplar, which abound in the lowlands, find here no fostering
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,elements.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A sort of continued vale, winding and abrupt, leads into the midst of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this region and through it. This vale serves the purpose of a road. It
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,is a tedious maze and perpetual declivity, and requires, from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passenger, a cautious and sure foot. Openings and ascents occasionally
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,present themselves on each side, which seem to promise you access to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interior region, but always terminate, sooner or later, in insuperable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,difficulties, at the verge of a precipice or the bottom of a steep.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Perhaps no one was more acquainted with this wilderness than I, but my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowledge was extremely imperfect. I had traversed parts of it, at an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,early age, in pursuit of berries and nuts, or led by a roaming
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disposition. Afterwards the sphere of my rambles was enlarged and their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,purpose changed. When Sarsefield came among us, I became his favourite
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scholar and the companion of all his pedestrian excursions. He was fond
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of penetrating into these recesses, partly from the love of picturesque
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scenes, partly to investigate its botanical and mineral productions, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,partly to carry on more effectually that species of instruction which he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had adopted with regard to me, and which chiefly consisted in moralizing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,narratives or synthetical reasonings. These excursions had familiarized
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me with its outlines and most accessible parts; but there was much
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which, perhaps, could never be reached without wings, and much the only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,paths to which I might forever overlook.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Every new excursion, indeed, added somewhat to my knowledge. New tracks
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were pursued, new prospects detected, and new summits were gained. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rambles were productive of incessant novelty, though they always
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,terminated in the prospect of limits that could not be overleaped. But
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,none of these had led me wider from my customary paths than that which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had taken place when in pursuit of Clithero. I had a faint remembrance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the valley into which I had descended after him; but till then I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,viewed it at a distance, and supposed it impossible to reach the bottom
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but by leaping from a precipice some hundred feet in height. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opposite steep seemed no less inaccessible, and the cavern at the bottom
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was impervious to any views which my former positions had enabled me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,take of it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My intention to re-examine this cave and ascertain whither it led had,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for a time, been suspended by different considerations. It was now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,revived with more energy than ever. I reflected that this had formerly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been haunted by Clithero, and might possibly have been the scene of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desperate act which he had meditated. It might at least conceal some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,token of his past existence. It might lead into spaces hitherto
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unvisited, and to summits from which wider landscapes might be seen.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,One morning I set out to explore this scene. The road which Clithero had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,taken was laboriously circuitous. On my return from the first pursuit of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him, I ascended the cliff in my former footsteps, but soon lighted on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the beaten track which I have already described. This enabled me to shun
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a thousand obstacles which had lately risen before me, and opened an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,easy passage to the cavern.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I once more traversed this way. The brow of the hill was gained. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ledges of which it consisted afforded sufficient footing, when the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attempt was made, though viewed at a distance they seemed to be too
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,narrow for that purpose. As I descended the rugged stair, I could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but wonder at the temerity and precipitation with which this descent had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,formerly been made. It seemed as if the noonday light and the tardiest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumspection would scarcely enable me to accomplish it; yet then it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been done with headlong speed, and with no guidance but the moon's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uncertain rays.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I reached the mouth of the cave. Till now I had forgotten that a lamp or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a torch might be necessary to direct my subterranean footsteps. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unwilling to defer the attempt. Light might possibly be requisite, if
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cave had no other outlet. Somewhat might present itself within to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the eyes, which might forever elude the hands, but I was more inclined
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to consider it merely as an avenue terminating in an opening on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,summit of the steep, or on the opposite side of the ridge. Caution might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supply the place of light, or, having explored the cave as far as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible at present, I might hereafter return, better furnished for the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scrutiny.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter X.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,With these determinations, I proceeded. The entrance was low, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compelled me to resort to hands as well as feet. At a few yards from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mouth the light disappeared, and I found myself immersed in the dunnest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obscurity. Had I not been persuaded that another had gone before me, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should have relinquished the attempt. I proceeded with the utmost
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,caution, always ascertaining, by outstretched arms, the height and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,breadth of the cavity before me. In a short time the dimensions expanded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on all sides, and permitted me to resume my feet.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I walked upon a smooth and gentle declivity. Presently the wall on one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,side, and the ceiling, receded beyond my reach. I began to fear that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should be involved in a maze, and should be disabled from returning. To
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obviate this danger it was requisite to adhere to the nearest wall, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conform to the direction which it should take, without straying through
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the palpable obscurity. Whether the ceiling was lofty or low, whether
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the opposite wall of the passage was distant or near, this I deemed no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,proper opportunity to investigate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In a short time, my progress was stopped by an abrupt descent. I set
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,down the advancing foot with caution, being aware that I might at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,next step encounter a bottomless pit. To the brink of such a one I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seemed now to have arrived. I stooped, and stretched my hand forward and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,downward, but all was vacuity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Here it was needful to pause. I had reached the brink of a cavity whose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depth it Avas impossible to ascertain. It might be a few inches beyond
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my reach, or hundreds of feet. By leaping down I might incur no injury,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or might plunge into a lake or dash myself to pieces on the points of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rocks.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now saw with new force the propriety of being furnished with a light.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The first suggestion was to return upon my footsteps, and resume my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,undertaking on the morrow. Yet, having advanced thus far, I felt
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reluctance to recede without accomplishing my purposes. I reflected
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,likewise that Clithero had boldly entered this recess, and had certainly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,come forth at a different avenue from that at which he entered.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At length it occurred to me that, though I could not go forward, yet I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might proceed along the edge of this cavity. This edge would be as safe
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a guidance, and would serve as well for a clue by which I might return,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as the wall which it was now necessary to forsake.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Intense dark is always the parent of fears. Impending injuries cannot in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this state be descried, nor shunned, nor repelled. I began to feel some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,faltering of my courage, and seated myself, for a few minutes, on a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stony mass which arose before me. My situation was new. The caverns I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had hitherto met with in this desert were chiefly formed of low-browed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rocks. They were chambers, more or less spacious, into which twilight
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was at least admitted; but here it seemed as if I were surrounded by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,barriers that would forever cut off my return to air and to light.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Presently I resumed my courage and proceeded. My road appeared now to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascend. On one side I seemed still upon the verge of a precipice, and on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the other all was empty and waste. I had gone no inconsiderable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance, and persuaded myself that my career would speedily terminate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In a short time, the space on the left hand was again occupied, and I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cautiously proceeded between the edge of the gulf and a rugged wall. As
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the space between them widened I adhered to the wall.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was not insensible that my path became more intricate and more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,difficult to retread in proportion as I advanced. I endeavoured to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,preserve a vivid conception of the way which I had already passed, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to keep the images of the left and right-hand wall, and the gulf, in due
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,succession in my memory.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The path, which had hitherto been considerably smooth, now became rugged
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and steep. Chilling damps, the secret trepidation which attended me, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length and difficulties of my way, enhanced by the ceaseless caution and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the numerous expedients which the utter darkness obliged me to employ,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,began to overpower my strength. I was frequently compelled to stop and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recruit myself by rest. These respites from toil were of use, but they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could not enable me to prosecute an endless journey, and to return was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scarcely a less arduous task than to proceed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I looked anxiously forward, in the hope of being comforted by some dim
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ray, which might assure me that my labours were approaching an end. At
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,last this propitious token appeared, and I issued forth into a kind of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chamber, one side of which was open to the air and allowed me to catch a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,portion of the checkered sky. This spectacle never before excited such
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exquisite sensations in my bosom. The air, likewise, breathed into the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cavern, was unspeakably delicious.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now found myself on the projecture of a rock. Above and below, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hill-side was nearly perpendicular. Opposite, and at the distance of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fifteen or twenty yards, was a similar ascent. At the bottom was a glen,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cold, narrow, and obscure. This projecture, which served as a kind of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vestibule to the cave, was connected with a ledge, by which, though not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without peril and toil, I was conducted to the summit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This summit was higher than any of those which were interposed between
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,itself and the river. A large part of this chaos of rocks and precipices
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was subjected, at one view, to the eye. The fertile lawns and vales
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which lay beyond this, the winding course of the river, and the slopes
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which rose on its farther side, were parts of this extensive scene.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These objects were at any time fitted to inspire rapture. Now my delight
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was enhanced by the contrast which this lightsome and serene element
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bore to the glooms from which I had lately emerged. My station, also,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was higher, and the limits of my view, consequently, more ample than any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I had hitherto enjoyed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I advanced to the outer verge of the hill, which I found to overlook a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steep no less inaccessible, and a glen equally profound. I changed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,frequently my station in order to diversify the scenery. At length it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,became necessary to inquire by what means I should return. I traversed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the edge of the hill, but on every side it was equally steep and always
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,too lofty to permit me to leap from it. As I kept along the verge, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perceived that it tended in a circular direction, and brought me back,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at last, to the spot from which I had set out. From this inspection, it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seemed as if return was impossible by any other way than that through
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cavern.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now turned my attention to the interior space. If you imagine a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cylindrical mass, with a cavity dug in the centre, whose edge conforms
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the exterior edge; and if you place in this cavity another cylinder,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,higher than that which surrounds it, but so small as to leave between
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,its sides and those of the cavity a hollow space, you will gain as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinct an image of this hill as words can convey. The summit of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inner rock was rugged and covered with trees of unequal growth. To reach
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this summit would not render my return easier; but its greater elevation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would extend my view, and perhaps furnish a spot from which the whole
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,horizon was conspicuous.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As I had traversed the outer, I now explored the inner, edge of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hill. At length I reached a spot where the chasm, separating the two
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rocks, was narrower than at any other part. At first view, it seemed as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,if it were possible to leap over it, but a nearer examination showed me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that the passage was impracticable. So far as my eye could estimate it,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the breadth was thirty or forty feet. I could scarcely venture to look
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beneath. The height was dizzy, and the walls, which approached each
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,other at top, receded at the bottom, so as to form the resemblance of an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,immense hall, lighted from a rift which some convulsion of nature had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made in the roof. Where I stood there ascended a perpetual mist,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasioned by a torrent that dashed along the rugged pavement below.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,From these objects I willingly turned my eye upon those before and above
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me, on the opposite ascent. A stream, rushing from above, fell into a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cavity, which its own force seemed gradually to have made. The noise and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the motion equally attracted my attention. There was a desolate and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solitary grandeur in the scene, enhanced by the circumstances in which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it was beheld, and by the perils through which I had recently passed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that had never before been witnessed by me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A sort of sanctity and awe environed it, owing to the consciousness of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,absolute and utter loneliness. It was probable that human feet had never
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before gained this recess, that human eyes had never been fixed upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these gushing waters. The aboriginal inhabitants had no motives to lead
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them into caves like this and ponder on the verge of such a precipice.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Their successors were still less likely to have wandered hither. Since
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the birth of this continent, I was probably the first who had deviated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thus remotely from the customary paths of men.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,While musing upon these ideas, my eye was fixed upon the foaming
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,current. At length I looked upon the rocks which confined and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,embarrassed its course. I admired their fantastic shapes and endless
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,irregularities. Passing from one to the other of these, my attention
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lighted, at length, as if by some magical transition, on--a human
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,countenance!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My surprise was so abrupt, and my sensations so tumultuous, that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forgot for a moment the perilous nature of my situation. I loosened my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hold of a pine-branch, which had been hitherto one of my supports, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,almost started from my seat. Had my station been in a slight degree
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nearer the brink than it was, I should have fallen headlong into the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,abyss.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To meet a human creature, even on that side of the chasm which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occupied, would have been wholly adverse to my expectation. My station
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was accessible by no other road than that through which I had passed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and no motives were imaginable by which others could be prompted to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,explore this road. But he whom I now beheld was seated where it seemed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impossible for human efforts to have placed him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But this affected me but little in comparison with other incidents. Not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,only the countenance was human, but, in spite of shaggy and tangled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,locks, and an air of melancholy wildness, I speedily recognised the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,features of the fugitive Clithero!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,One glance was not sufficient to make me acquainted with this scene. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had come hither partly in pursuit of this man, but some casual appendage
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his person, something which should indicate his past rather than his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,present existence, was all that I hoped to find. That he should be found
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,alive in this desert, that he should have gained this summit, access to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which was apparently impossible, were scarcely within the boundaries of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,belief.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His scanty and coarse garb had been nearly rent away by brambles and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thorns; his arms, bosom, and cheeks were overgrown and half concealed by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hair. There was somewhat in his attitude and looks denoting more than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,anarchy of thoughts and passions. His rueful, ghastly, and immovable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eyes testified not only that his mind was ravaged by despair, but that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he was pinched with famine.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These proofs of his misery thrilled to my inmost heart. Horror and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shuddering invaded me as I stood gazing upon him, and, for a time, I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without the power of deliberating on the measures which it was my duty
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to adopt for his relief. The first suggestion was, by calling, to inform
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him of my presence. I knew not what counsel or comfort to offer. By what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,words to bespeak his attention, or by what topics to mollify his direful
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passions, I knew not. Though so near, the gulf by which we were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,separated was impassable. All that I could do was to speak.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My surprise and my horror were still strong enough to give a shrill and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,piercing tone to my voice. The chasm and the rocks loudened and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reverberated my accents while I exclaimed,--"_Man! Clithero!_"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My summons was effectual. He shook off his trance in a moment. He had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been stretched upon his back, with his eyes fixed upon a craggy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,projecture above, as if he were in momentary expectation of its fall and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,crushing him to atoms. Now he started on his feet. He was conscious of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the voice, but not of the quarter whence it came. He was looking
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,anxiously around when I again spoke:--"Look hither. It is I who called."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He looked. Astonishment was now mingled with every other dreadful
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,meaning in his visage. He clasped his hands together and bent forward,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as if to satisfy himself that his summoner was real. At the next moment
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he drew back, placed his hands upon his breast, and fixed his eyes on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the ground.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This pause was not likely to be broken but by me. I was preparing again
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to speak. To be more distinctly heard, I advanced closer to the brink.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,During this action, my eye was necessarily withdrawn from him. Having
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gained a somewhat nearer station, I looked again, but--he was gone!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The seat which he so lately occupied was empty. I was not forewarned of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his disappearance or directed to the course of his flight by any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rustling among leaves. These, indeed, would have been overpowered by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,noise of the cataract. The place where he sat was the bottom of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cavity, one side of which terminated in the verge of the abyss, but the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,other sides were perpendicular or overhanging. Surely he had not leaped
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into this gulf; and yet that he had so speedily scaled the steep was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impossible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I looked into the gulf, but the depth and the gloom allowed me to see
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing with distinctness. His cries or groans could not be overheard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,amidst the uproar of the waters. His fall must have instantly destroyed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him, and that he had fallen was the only conclusion I could draw.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My sensations on this incident cannot be easily described. The image of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this man's despair, and of the sudden catastrophe to which my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inauspicious interference had led, filled me with compunction and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,terror. Some of my fears were relieved by the new conjecture, that,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,behind the rock on which he had lain, there might be some aperture or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pit into which he had descended, or in which he might be concealed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I derived consolation from this conjecture. Not only the evil which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dreaded might not have happened, but some alleviation of his misery was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible. Could I arrest his footsteps and win his attention, I might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,able to insinuate the lessons of fortitude; but if words were impotent,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and arguments were nugatory, yet to sit by him in silence, to moisten
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his hand with tears, to sigh in unison, to offer him the spectacle of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sympathy, the solace of believing that his demerits were not estimated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by so rigid a standard by others as by himself, that one at least among
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his fellow-men regarded him with love and pity, could not fail to be of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benign influence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These thoughts inspired me with new zeal. To effect my purpose it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,requisite to reach the opposite steep. I was now convinced that this was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not an impracticable undertaking, since Clithero had already performed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it. I once more made the circuit of the hill. Every side was steep and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of enormous height, and the gulf was nowhere so narrow as at this spot.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I therefore returned hither, and once more pondered on the means of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passing this tremendous chasm in safety.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Casting my eyes upward, I noted the tree at the root of which I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,standing. I compared the breadth of the gulf with the length of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trunk of this tree, and it appeared very suitable for a bridge. Happily
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it grew obliquely, and, if felled by an axe, would probably fall of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,itself, in such a manner as to be suspended across the chasm. The stock
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was thick enough to afford me footing, and would enable me to reach the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opposite declivity without danger or delay.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A more careful examination of the spot, the site of the tree, its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dimensions, and the direction of its growth, convinced me fully of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,practicability of this expedient, and I determined to carry it into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,immediate execution. For this end I must hasten home, procure an axe,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and return with all expedition hither. I took my former way, once more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entered the subterranean avenue, and slowly re-emerged into day. Before
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I reached home, the evening was at hand, and my tired limbs and jaded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spirits obliged me to defer my undertaking till the morrow.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Though my limbs were at rest, my thoughts were active through the night.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I carefully reviewed the situation of this hill, and was unable to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conjecture by what means Clithero could place himself upon it. Unless he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasionally returned to the habitable grounds, it was impossible for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him to escape perishing by famine. He might intend to destroy himself by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this means, and my first efforts were to be employed to overcome this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fatal resolution. To persuade him to leave his desolate haunts might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a laborious and tedious task; meanwhile, all my benevolent intentions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would be frustrated by his want of sustenance. It was proper, therefore,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to carry bread with me, and to place it before him. The sight of food,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the urgencies of hunger, and my vehement entreaties, might prevail on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him to eat, though no expostulations might suffice to make him seek food
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at a distance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Next morning I stored a small bag with meat and bread, and, throwing an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,axe on my shoulder, set out, without informing any one of my intentions,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for the hill. My passage was rendered more difficult by these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,encumbrances, but my perseverance surmounted every impediment, and I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gained, in a few hours, the foot of the tree whose trunk was to serve me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for a bridge. In this journey I saw no traces of the fugitive.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A new survey of the tree confirmed my former conclusions, and I began my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,work with diligence. My strokes were repeated by a thousand echoes, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I paused at first, somewhat startled by reverberations which made it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appear as if not one but a score of axes were employed at the same time
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on both sides of the gulf.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Quickly the tree fell, and exactly in the manner which I expected arid
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desired. The wide-spread limbs occupied and choked up the channel of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,torrent, and compelled it to seek a new outlet and multiplied its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,murmurs. I dared not trust myself to cross it in an upright posture, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,clung, with hands and feet, to its rugged bark. Having reached the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opposite cliff, I proceeded to examine the spot where Clithero had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappeared. My fondest hopes were realized, for a considerable cavity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appeared, which, on a former day, had been concealed from my distant
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,view by the rock.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was obvious to conclude that this was his present habitation, or that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an avenue, conducting hither and terminating in the unexplored sides of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this pit, was that by which he had come hither, and by which he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,retired. I could not hesitate long to slide into the pit. I found an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entrance through which I fearlessly penetrated. I was prepared to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,encounter obstacles and perils similar to those which I have already
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,described, but was rescued from them by ascending, in a few minutes,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into a kind of passage, open above, but walled by a continued rock on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,both sides. The sides of this passage conformed with the utmost
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exactness to each other. Nature, at some former period, had occasioned
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the solid mass to dispart at this place, and had thus afforded access to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the summit of the hill. Loose stones and ragged points formed the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flooring of this passage, which rapidly and circuitously ascended.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was now within a few yards of the surface of the rock. The passage
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opened into a kind of chamber or pit, the sides of which were not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,difficult to climb. I rejoiced at the prospect of this termination of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,journey. Here I paused, and, throwing my weary limbs on the ground,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,began to examine the objects around me, and to meditate on the steps
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that were next to be taken.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My first glance lighted on the very being of whom I was in search.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Stretched upon a bed of moss, at the distance of a few feet from my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,station, I beheld Clithero. He had not been roused by my approach,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,though my footsteps were perpetually stumbling and sliding. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reflection gave birth to the fear that he was dead. A nearer inspection
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dispelled my apprehensions, and showed me that he was merely buried in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,profound slumber. Those vigils must indeed have been long which were at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,last succeeded by a sleep so oblivious.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This meeting was, in the highest degree, propitious. It not only assured
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me of his existence, but proved that his miseries were capable of being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspended. His slumber enabled me to pause, to ruminate on the manner by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which his understanding might be most successfully addressed; to collect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and arrange the topics fitted to rectify his gloomy and disastrous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perceptions.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thou knowest that I am qualified for such tasks neither by my education
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nor my genius. The headlong and ferocious energies of this man could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be repelled or diverted into better paths by efforts so undisciplined as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mine. A despair so stormy and impetuous would drown my feeble accents.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How should I attempt to reason with him? How should I outroot
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prepossessions so inveterate,--the fruits of his earliest education,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fostered and matured by the observation and experience of his whole
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life? How should I convince him that, since the death of Wiatte was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intended, the deed was without crime? that, if it had been deliberately
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,concerted, it was still a virtue, since his own life could by no other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means be preserved? that when he pointed a dagger at the bosom of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mistress he was actuated, not by avarice, or ambition, or revenge, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,malice? He desired to confer on her the highest and the only benefit of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which he believed her capable. He sought to rescue her from tormenting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regrets and lingering agonies.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These positions were sufficiently just to my own view, but I was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,called upon to reduce them to practice. I had not to struggle with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consciousness of having been rescued, by some miraculous contingency,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from imbruing my hands in the blood of her whom I adored; of having
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,drawn upon myself suspicions of ingratitude and murder too deep to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ever effaced; of having bereft myself of love, and honour, and friends,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and spotless reputation; of having doomed myself to infamy and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,detestation, to hopeless exile, penury, and servile toil. These were the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,evils which his malignant destiny had made the unalterable portion of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero, and how should my imperfect eloquence annihilate these evils?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Every man, not himself the victim of irretrievable disasters, perceives
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the folly of ruminating on the past, and of fostering a grief which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cannot reverse or recall the decrees of an immutable necessity; but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,every man who suffers is unavoidably shackled by the errors which he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,censures in his neighbour, and his efforts to relieve himself are as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fruitless as those with which he attempted the relief of others.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,No topic, therefore, could be properly employed by me on the present
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasion. All that I could do was to offer him food, and, by pathetic
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supplications, to prevail on him to eat. Famine, however obstinate,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would scarcely refrain when bread was placed within sight and reach.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,When made to swerve from his resolution in one instance, it would be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,less difficult to conquer it a second time. The magic of sympathy, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perseverance of benevolence, though silent, might work a gradual and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,secret revolution, and better thoughts might insensibly displace those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desperate suggestions which now governed him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Having revolved these ideas, I placed the food which I had brought at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his right hand, and, seating myself at his feet, attentively surveyed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his countenance. The emotions which were visible during wakefulness had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vanished during this cessation of remembrance and remorse, or were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,faintly discernible. They served to dignify and solemnize his features,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and to embellish those immutable lines which betokened the spirit of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,better days. Lineaments were now observed which could never coexist with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,folly or associate with obdurate guilt.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had no inclination to awaken him. This respite was too sweet to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,needlessly abridged. I determined to await the operation of nature, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to prolong, by silence and by keeping interruption at a distance, this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,salutary period of forgetfulness. This interval permitted new ideas to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,succeed in my mind.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero believed his solitude to be unapproachable. What new expedients
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to escape inquiry and intrusion might not my presence suggest! Might he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not vanish, as he had done on the former day, and afford me no time to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assail his constancy and tempt his hunger? If, however, I withdrew
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,during his sleep, he would awake without disturbance, and be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unconscious, for a time, that his secrecy had been violated. He would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quickly perceive the victuals, and would need no foreign inducements to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eat. A provision so unexpected and extraordinary might suggest new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thoughts, and be construed into a kind of heavenly condemnation of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,purpose. He would not readily suspect the motives or person of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,visitant, would take no precaution against the repetition of my visit,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, at the same time, our interview would not be attended with so much
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surprise. The more I revolved these reflections, the greater force they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acquired. At length, I determined to withdraw, and, leaving the food
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,where it could scarcely fail of attracting his notice, I returned by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,way that I had come. I had scarcely reached home, when a messenger from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Inglefield arrived, requesting me to spend the succeeding night at his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,house, as some engagement had occurred to draw him to the city.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I readily complied with this request. It was not necessary, however, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be early in my visit. I deferred going till the evening was far
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,advanced. My way led under the branches of the elm which recent events
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had rendered so memorable. Hence my reflections reverted to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumstances which had lately occurred in connection with this tree.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I paused, for some time, under its shade. I marked the spot where
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero had been discovered digging. It showed marks of being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unsettled; but the sod which had formerly covered it, and which had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lately been removed, was now carefully replaced. This had not been done
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by him on that occasion in which I was a witness of his behaviour. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,earth was then hastily removed, and as hastily thrown again into the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hole from which it had been taken.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some curiosity was naturally excited by this appearance. Either some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,other person, or Clithero, on a subsequent occasion, had been here. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was now likewise led to reflect on the possible motives that prompted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the maniac to turn up this earth. There is always some significance in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the actions of a sleeper. Somewhat was, perhaps, buried in this spot,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,connected with the history of Mrs. Lorimer or of Clarice. Was it not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible to ascertain the truth in this respect?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was but one method. By carefully uncovering this hole, and digging
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as deep as Clithero had already dug, it would quickly appear whether any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thing was hidden. To do this publicly by daylight was evidently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indiscreet. Besides, a moment's delay was superfluous. The night had now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fallen, and before it was past this new undertaking might be finished.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,An interview was, if possible, to be gained with Clithero on the morrow,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and for this interview the discoveries made on this spot might eminently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,qualify me. Influenced by these considerations, I resolved to dig. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,first, however, to converse an hour with the housekeeper, and then to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,withdraw to my chamber. When the family were all retired, and there was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no fear of observation or interruption, I proposed to rise and hasten,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with a proper implement, hither.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,One chamber in Inglefield's house was usually reserved for visitants. In
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this chamber thy unfortunate brother died, and here it was that I was to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sleep. The image of its last inhabitant could not fail of being called
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,up, and of banishing repose; but the scheme which I had meditated was an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,additional incitement to watchfulness. Hither I repaired at the due
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,season, having previously furnished myself with candles, since I knew
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not what might occur to make a light necessary.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I did not go to bed, but either sat musing by a table or walked across
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the room. The bed before me was that on which my friend breathed his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,last. To rest my head upon the same pillow, to lie on that pallet which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sustained his cold and motionless limbs, were provocations to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remembrance and grief that I desired to shun. I endeavoured to fill my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mind with more recent incidents, with the disasters of Clithero, my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subterranean adventures, and the probable issue of the schemes which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now contemplated.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I recalled the conversation which had just ended with the housekeeper.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero had been our theme, but she had dealt chiefly in repetitions of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,what had formerly been related by her or by Inglefield. I inquired what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this man had left behind, and found that it consisted of a square box,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,put together by himself with uncommon strength, but of rugged
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,workmanship. She proceeded to mention that she had advised her brother,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Mr. Inglefield, to break open this box and ascertain its contents; but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this he did not think himself justified in doing. Clithero was guilty of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no known crime, was responsible to no one for his actions, and might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some time return to claim his property. This box contained nothing with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which others had a right to meddle. Somewhat might be found in it,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,throwing light upon his past or present situation; but curiosity was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to be gratified by these means. What Clithero thought proper to conceal,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it was criminal for us to extort from him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The housekeeper was by no means convinced by these arguments, and at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length obtained her brother's permission to try whether any of her own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,keys would unlock this chest. The keys were produced, but no lock nor
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,keyhole were discoverable. The lid was fast, but by what means it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fastened the most accurate inspection could not detect. Hence she was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compelled to lay aside her project. This chest had always stood in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chamber which I now occupied.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These incidents were now remembered, and I felt disposed to profit by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this opportunity of examining this box. It stood in a corner, and was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,easily distinguished by its form. I lifted it and found its weight by no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means extraordinary. Its structure was remarkable. It consisted of six
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sides, square and of similar dimensions. These were joined, not by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mortise and tennon, not by nails, not by hinges, but the junction was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accurate. The means by which they were made to cohere were invisible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Appearances on every side were uniform, nor were there any marks by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which the lid was distinguishable from its other surfaces.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,During his residence with Inglefield, many specimens of mechanical
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ingenuity were given by his servant. This was the workmanship of his own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hands. I looked at it for some time, till the desire insensibly arose of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opening it and examining its contents.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had no more right to do this than the Inglefields; perhaps, indeed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this curiosity was more absurd, and the gratification more culpable, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me than in them. I was acquainted with the history of Clithero's past
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life, and with his present condition. Respecting these, I had no new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intelligence to gain, and no doubts to solve. What excuse could I make
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the proprietor, should he ever reappear to claim his own, or to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Inglefield for breaking open a receptacle which all the maxims of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,society combine to render sacred?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But could not my end be gained without violence? The means of opening
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might present themselves on a patient scrutiny. The lid might be raised
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and shut down again without any tokens of my act; its contents might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,examined, and all things restored to their former condition, in a few
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,minutes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I intended not a theft. I intended to benefit myself without inflicting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,injury on others. Nay, might not the discoveries I should make throw
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,light upon the conduct of this extraordinary man which his own narrative
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had withheld? Was there reason to confide implicitly on the tale which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had heard?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In spite of the testimony of my own feelings, the miseries of Clithero
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appeared in some degree fantastic and groundless. A thousand conceivable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,motives might induce him to pervert or conceal the truth. If he were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thoroughly known, his character might assume a new appearance; and what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,is now so difficult to reconcile to common maxims might prove perfectly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consistent with them. I desire to restore him to peace; but a thorough
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowledge of his actions is necessary, both to show that he is worthy of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compassion, and to suggest the best means of extirpating his errors. It
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was possible that this box contained the means of this knowledge.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There were likewise other motives, which, as they possessed some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,influence, however small, deserve to be mentioned. Thou knowest that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,also am a mechanist. I had constructed a writing-desk and cabinet, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I had endeavoured to combine the properties of secrecy, security,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and strength, in the highest possible degree. I looked upon this,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,therefore, with the eye of an artist, and was solicitous to know the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,principles on which it was formed. I determined to examine, and, if
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible, to open it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XII.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I surveyed it with the utmost attention. All its parts appeared equally
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solid and smooth. It could not be doubted that one of its sides served
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the purpose of a lid, and was possible to be raised. Mere strength could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not be applied to raise it, because there was no projecture which might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be firmly held by the hand, and by which force could be exerted. Some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spring, therefore, secretly existed, which might forever elude the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,senses, but on which the hand, by being moved over it in all directions,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might accidentally light.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This process was effectual. A touch, casually applied at an angle, drove
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,back a bolt, and a spring, at the same time, was set in action, by which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the lid was raised above half an inch. No event could be supposed more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortuitous than this. A hundred hands might have sought in vain for this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spring. The spot in which a certain degree of pressure was sufficient to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,produce this effect was, of all, the least likely to attract notice or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,awaken suspicion.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I opened the trunk with eagerness. The space within was divided into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,numerous compartments, none of which contained any thing of moment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Tools of different and curious constructions, and remnants of minute
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,machinery, were all that offered themselves to my notice.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My expectations being thus frustrated, I proceeded to restore things to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their former state. I attempted to close the lid; but the spring which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had raised it refused to bend. No measure that I could adopt enabled me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to place the lid in the same situation in which I had found it. In my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,efforts to press down the lid, which were augmented in proportion to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resistance that I met with, the spring was broken. This obstacle being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,removed, the lid resumed its proper place; but no means, within the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reach of my ingenuity to discover, enabled me to push forward the bolt,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and thus to restore the fastening.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now perceived that Clithero had provided not only against the opening
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his cabinet, but likewise against the possibility of concealing that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it had been opened. This discovery threw me into some confusion. I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been tempted thus far by the belief that my action was without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,witnesses, and might be forever concealed. This opinion was now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confuted. If Clithero should ever reclaim his property, he would not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fail to detect the violence of which I had been guilty. Inglefield would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disapprove in another what he had not permitted to himself, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unauthorized and clandestine manner in which I had behaved would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,aggravate, in his eyes, the heinousness of my offence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But now there was no remedy. All that remained was to hinder suspicion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from lighting on the innocent, and to confess, to my friend, the offence
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I had committed. Meanwhile my first project was resumed, and, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,family being now wrapped in profound sleep, I left my chamber, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,proceeded to the elm. The moon was extremely brilliant, but I hoped that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this unfrequented road and unseasonable hour would hinder me from being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,observed. My chamber was above the kitchen, with which it communicated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by a small staircase, and the building to which it belonged was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,connected with the dwelling by a gallery. I extinguished the light, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,left it in the kitchen, intending to relight it, by the embers that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,still glowed on the hearth, on my return.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I began to remove the sod and cast out the earth, with little confidence
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the success of my project. The issue of my examination of the box
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,humbled and disheartened me. For some time I found nothing that tended
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to invigorate my hopes. I determined, however, to descend, as long as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the unsettled condition of the earth showed me that some one had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,preceded me. Small masses of stone were occasionally met with, which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,served only to perplex me with groundless expectations. At length my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spade struck upon something which emitted a very different sound. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quickly drew it forth, and found it to be wood. Its regular form, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the crevices which were faintly discernible, persuaded me that it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,human workmanship, and that there was a cavity within. The place in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which it was found easily suggested some connection between this and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destiny of Clithero. Covering up the hole with speed, I hastened with my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prize to the house. The door by which the kitchen was entered was not to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be seen from the road. It opened on a field, the farther limit of which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was a ledge of rocks, which formed, on this side, the boundary of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Inglefield's estate and the westernmost barrier of Norwalk.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As I turned the angle of the house, and came in view of this door,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,methought I saw a figure issue from it. I was startled at this incident,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, stopping, crouched close to the wall, that I might not be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovered. As soon as the figure passed beyond the verge of the shade,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it was easily distinguished to be that of Clithero! He crossed the field
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with a rapid pace, and quickly passed beyond the reach of my eye.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This appearance was mysterious. For what end he should visit this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,habitation could not be guessed. Was the contingency to be lamented in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequence of which an interview had been avoided? Would it have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compelled me to explain the broken condition of his trunk? I knew not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whether to rejoice at having avoided this interview, or to deplore it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These thoughts did not divert me from examining the nature of the prize
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I had gained. I relighted my candle and hied once more to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chamber. The first object which, on entering it, attracted my attention,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was the cabinet broken into twenty fragments, on the hearth. I had left
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it on a low table, at a distant corner of the room.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,No conclusion could be formed but that Clithero had been here, had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovered the violence which had been committed on his property, and,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the first transport of his indignation, had shattered it to pieces. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shuddered on reflecting how near I had been to being detected by him in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the very act, and by how small an interval I had escaped that resentment
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which, in that case, would have probably been wreaked upon me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My attention was withdrawn, at length, from this object, and fixed upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the contents of the box which I had dug up. This was equally
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inaccessible with the other. I had not the same motives for caution and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forbearance. I was somewhat desperate, as the consequences of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indiscretion could not be aggravated, and my curiosity was more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impetuous with regard to the smaller than to the larger cabinet. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,placed it on the ground and crushed it to pieces with my heel.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Something was within. I brought it to the light, and, after loosing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,numerous folds, at length drew forth a volume. No object in the circle
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of nature was more adapted than this to rouse up all my faculties. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,feelings were anew excited on observing that it was a manuscript. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bolted the door, and, drawing near the light, opened and began to read.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A few pages were sufficient to explain the nature of the work. Clithero
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had mentioned that his lady had composed a vindication of her conduct
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,towards her brother when her intercession in his favour was solicited
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and refused. This performance had never been published, but had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,read by many, and was preserved by her friends as a precious monument of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her genius and her virtue. This manuscript was now before me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That Clithero should preserve this manuscript, amidst the wreck of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hopes and fortunes, was apparently conformable to his temper. That,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,having formed the resolution to die, he should seek to hide this volume
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the profane curiosity of survivors, was a natural proceeding. To
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bury it rather than to burn, or disperse it into fragments, would be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggested by the wish to conceal, without committing what his heated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fancy would regard as sacrilege. To bury it beneath the elm was dictated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by no fortuitous or inexplicable caprice. This event could scarcely fail
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of exercising some influence on the perturbations of his sleep, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thus, in addition to other causes, might his hovering near this trunk,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and throwing up this earth, in the intervals of slumber, be accounted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for. Clithero, indeed, had not mentioned this proceeding in the course
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his narrative; but that would have contravened the end for which he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had provided a grave for this book.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I read this copious tale with unspeakable eagerness. It essentially
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,agreed with that which had been told by Clithero. By drawing forth
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,events into all their circumstances, more distinct impressions were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,produced on the mind, and proofs of fortitude and equanimity were here
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,given to which I had hitherto known no parallel. No wonder that a soul
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,like Clithero's, pervaded by these proofs of inimitable excellence, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thrillingly alive to the passion of virtuous fame, and the value of that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,existence which he had destroyed, should be overborne by horror at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,view of the past.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The instability of life and happiness was forcibly illustrated, as well
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as the perniciousness of error. Exempt as this lady was from almost
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,every defect, she was indebted for her ruin to absurd opinions of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sacredness of consanguinity, to her anxiety for the preservation of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ruffian because that ruffian was her brother. The spirit of Clithero was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enlightened and erect, but he weakly suffered the dictates of eternal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,justice to be swallowed up by gratitude. The dread of unjust upbraiding
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hurried him to murder and to suicide, and the imputation of imaginary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guilt impelled him to the perpetration of genuine and enormous crimes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The perusal of this volume ended not but with the night. Contrary to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hopes, the next day was stormy and wet. This did not deter me from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,visiting the mountain. Slippery paths and muddy torrents were no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obstacles to the purposes which I had adopted. I wrapped myself, and a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bag of provisions, in a cloak of painted canvas, and speeded to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dwelling of Clithero.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I passed through the cave and reached the bridge which my own ingenuity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had formed. At that moment, torrents of rain poured from above, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stronger blasts thundered amidst these desolate recesses and profound
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chasms. Instead of lamenting the prevalence of this tempest, I now began
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to regard it with pleasure. It conferred new forms of sublimity and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grandeur on this scene.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As I crept with hands and feet along my imperfect bridge, a sudden gust
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had nearly whirled me into the frightful abyss below. To preserve
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,myself, I was obliged to loose my hold of my burden, and it fell into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the gulf. This incident disconcerted and distressed me. As soon as I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,effected my dangerous passage, I screened myself behind a cliff and gave
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,myself up to reflection.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The purpose of this arduous journey was defeated by the loss of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,provisions I had brought. I despaired of winning the attention of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fugitive to supplications, or arguments tending to smother remorse or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,revive his fortitude. The scope of my efforts was to consist in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vanquishing his aversion to food; but these efforts would now be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,useless, since I had no power to supply his cravings.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This deficiency, however, was easily supplied. I had only to return home
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and supply myself anew. No time was to be lost in doing this; but I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,willing to remain under this shelter till the fury of the tempest had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subsided. Besides, I was not certain that Clithero had again retreated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hither. It was requisite to explore the summit of this hill, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascertain whether it had any inhabitant. I might likewise discover what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been the success of my former experiment, and whether the food,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which had been left here on the former day, was consumed or neglected.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,While occupied with these reflections, my eyes were fixed upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opposite steeps. The tops of the trees, waving to and fro in the wildest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,commotion, and their trunks, occasionally bending to the blast, which,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in these lofty regions, blew with a violence unknown in the tracts
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,below, exhibited an awful spectacle. At length, my attention was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attracted by the trunk which lay across the gulf, and which I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,converted into a bridge. I perceived that it had already somewhat
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,swerved from its original position, that every blast broke or loosened
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some of the fibres by which its roots were connected with the opposite
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bank, and that, if the storm did not speedily abate, there was imminent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,danger of its being torn from the rock and precipitated into the chasm.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus my retreat would be cut off, and the evils from which I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,endeavouring to rescue another would be experienced by myself.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I did not just then reflect that Clithero had found access to this hill
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by other means, and that the avenue by which he came would be equally
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,commodious to me. I believed my destiny to hang upon the expedition with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I should recross this gulf. The moments that were spent in these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deliberations were critical, and I shuddered to observe that the trunk
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was held in its place by one or two fibres which were already stretched
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,almost to breaking.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To pass along the trunk, rendered slippery by the wet and unsteadfast by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the wind, was imminently dangerous. To maintain my hold, in passing, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,defiance of the whirlwind, required the most vigorous exertions. For
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this end it was necessary to discommode myself of my cloak, and of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,volume which I carried in the pocket of my cloak. I believed there was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no reason to dread their being destroyed or purloined, if left, for a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,few hours or a day, in this recess. If laid beside a stone, under
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shelter of this cliff, they would, no doubt, remain unmolested till the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappearance of the storm should permit me to revisit this spot in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,afternoon or on the morrow.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Just as I had disposed of these encumbrances and had risen from my seat,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my attention was again called to the opposite steep, by the most
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unwelcome object that, at this time, could possibly occur. Something was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perceived moving among the bushes and rocks, which, for a time, I hoped
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was no more than a raccoon or opossum, but which presently appeared to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be a panther. His gray coat, extended claws, fiery eyes, and a cry which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he at that moment uttered, and which, by its resemblance to the human
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,voice, is peculiarly terrific, denoted him to be the most ferocious and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,untamable of that detested race.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,[Footnote: The gray cougar. This animal has all the essential
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,characteristics of a tiger. Though somewhat inferior in size and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,strength, these are such as to make him equally formidable to man.]
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The industry of our hunters has nearly banished animals of prey from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these precincts. The fastnesses of Norwalk, however, could not but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,afford refuge to some of them. Of late I had met them so rarely, that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fears were seldom alive, and I trod, without caution, the ruggedest and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,most solitary haunts. Still, however, I had seldom been unfurnished in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my rambles with the means of defence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My temper never delighted in carnage and blood. I found no pleasure in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plunging into bogs, wading through rivulets, and penetrating thickets,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for the sake of dispatching woodcocks and squirrels. To watch their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gambols and flittings, and invite them to my hand, was my darling
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,amusement when loitering among the woods and the rocks. It was much
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,otherwise, however, with regard to rattlesnakes and panthers. These I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thought it no breach of duty to exterminate wherever they could be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,found. These judicious and sanguinary spoilers were equally the enemies
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of man and of the harmless race that sported in the trees, and many of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their skins are still preserved by me as trophies of my juvenile
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prowess.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As hunting was never my trade or my sport, I never loaded myself with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fowling-piece or rifle. Assiduous exercise had made me master of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,weapon of much easier carriage, and, within a moderate distance, more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destructive and unerring. This was the tomahawk. With this I have often
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,severed an oak-branch, and cut the sinews of a catamount, at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance of sixty feet.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The unfrequency with which I had lately encountered this foe, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,encumbrance of provision, made me neglect, on this occasion, to bring
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with me my usual arms. The beast that was now before me, when stimulated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by hunger, was accustomed to assail whatever could provide him with a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,banquet of blood. He would set upon the man and the deer with equal and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,irresistible ferocity. His sagacity was equal to his strength, and he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seemed able to discover when his antagonist was armed and prepared for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,defence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My past experience enabled me to estimate the full extent of my danger.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He sat on the brow of the steep, eyeing the bridge, and apparently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deliberating whether he should cross it. It was probable that he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scented my footsteps thus far, and, should he pass over, his vigilance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could scarcely fail of detecting my asylum. The pit into which Clithero
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had sunk from my view was at some distance. To reach it was the first
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impulse of my fear, but this could not be done without exciting the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,observation and pursuit of this enemy. I deeply regretted the untoward
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chance that had led me, when I first came over, to a different shelter.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Should he retain his present station, my danger was scarcely lessened.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To pass over in the face of a famished tiger was only to rush upon my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fate. The falling of the trunk, which had lately been so anxiously
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deprecated, was now, with no less solicitude, desired. Every new gust, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hoped, would tear asunder its remaining bands, and, by cutting off all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,communication between the opposite steeps, place me in security.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My hopes, however, were destined to be frustrated. The fibres of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prostrate tree were obstinately tenacious of their hold, and presently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the animal scrambled down the rock and proceeded to cross it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Of all kinds of death, that which now menaced me was the most abhorred.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To die by disease, or by the hand of a fellow-creature, was propitious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and lenient in comparison with being rent to pieces by the fangs of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,savage. To perish in this obscure retreat, by means so impervious to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,anxious curiosity of my friends, to lose my portion of existence by so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,untoward and ignoble a destiny, was insupportable. I bitterly deplored
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my rashness in coming hither unprovided for an encounter like this.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The evil of my present circumstances consisted chiefly in suspense. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,death was unavoidable, but my imagination had leisure to torment itself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by anticipations. One foot of the savage was slowly and cautiously moved
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,after the other. He struck his claws so deeply into the bark that they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were with difficulty withdrawn. At length he leaped upon the ground. We
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were now separated by an interval of scarcely eight feet. To leave the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spot where I crouched was impossible. Behind and beside me, the cliff
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rose perpendicularly, and before me was this grim and terrific visage. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shrunk still closer to the ground and closed my eyes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,From this pause of horror I was aroused by the noise occasioned by a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,second spring of the animal. He leaped into the pit, in which I had so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deeply regretted that I had not taken refuge, and disappeared. My rescue
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was so sudden, and so much beyond my belief or my hope, that I doubted,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for a moment, whether my senses did not deceive me. This opportunity of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,escape was not to be neglected. I left my place, and scrambled over the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trunk with a precipitation which had liked to have proved fatal. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tree groaned and shook under me, the wind blew with unexampled violence,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and I had scarcely reached the opposite steep when the roots were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,severed from the rock and the whole fell thundering to the bottom of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chasm.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My trepidations were not speedily quieted. I looked back with wonder on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my hairbreadth escape, and on that singular concurrence of events which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had placed me, in so short a period, in absolute security. Had the trunk
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fallen a moment earlier, I should have been imprisoned on the hill or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thrown headlong. Had its fall been delayed another moment, I should have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been pursued; for the beast now issued from his den, and testified his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surprise and disappointment by tokens the sight of which made my blood
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,run cold.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He saw me, and hastened to the verge of the chasm. He squatted on his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hind-legs and assumed the attitude of one preparing to leap. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consternation was excited afresh by these appearances. It seemed at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,first as if the rift was too wide for any power of muscles to carry him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in safety over; but I knew the unparalleled agility of this animal, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that his experience had made him a better judge of the practicability of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this exploit than I was. Still there was hope that he would relinquish
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this design as desperate. This hope was quickly at an end. He sprung,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and his fore-legs touched the verge of the rock on which I stood. In
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spite of vehement exertions, however, the surface was too smooth and too
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hard to allow him to make good his hold. He fell, and a piercing cry,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uttered below, showed that nothing had obstructed his descent to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bottom.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus was I again rescued from death. Nothing but the pressure of famine
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could have prompted this savage to so audacious and hazardous an effort;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but, by yielding to this impulse, he had made my future visits to this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spot exempt from peril. Clithero was, likewise, relieved from a danger
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that was imminent and unforeseen. Prowling over these grounds, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,panther could scarcely have failed to meet with this solitary fugitive.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Had the animal lived, my first duty would have been to have sought him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,out and assailed him with my tomahawk; but no undertaking would have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been more hazardous. Lurking in the grass, or in the branches of a tree,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his eye might have descried my approach, he might leap upon me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unperceived, and my weapon would be useless.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,With a heart beating with unwonted rapidity, I once more descended the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cliff, entered the cavern, and arrived at Huntly farm, drenched with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rain, and exhausted by fatigue.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,By night the storm was dispelled; but my exhausted strength would not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,allow me to return to the mountain. At the customary hour I retired to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my chamber. I incessantly ruminated on the adventures of the last day,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and inquired into the conduct which I was next to pursue.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The bridge being destroyed, my customary access was cut off. There was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no possibility of restoring this bridge. My strength would not suffice
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to drag a fallen tree from a distance, and there was none whose position
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would abridge or supersede that labour. Some other expedient must,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,therefore, be discovered to pass this chasm.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I reviewed the circumstances of my subterranean journey. The cavern was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imperfectly explored. Its branches might be numerous. That which I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hitherto pursued terminated in an opening at a considerable distance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the bottom. Other branches might exist, some of which might lead to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the foot of the precipice, and thence a communication might be found
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with the summit of the interior hill.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The danger of wandering into dark and untried paths, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,commodiousness of that road which had at first been taken, were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficient reasons for having hitherto suspended my examination of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,different branches of this labyrinth. Now my customary road was no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,longer practicable, and another was to be carefully explored. For this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,end, on my next journey to the mountain, I determined to take with me a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lamp, and unravel this darksome maze: this project I resolved to execute
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the next day.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now recollected what, if it had more seasonably occurred, would have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,taught me caution. Some months before this a farmer, living in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,skirts of Norwalk, discovered two marauders in his field, whom he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imagined to be a male and female panther. They had destroyed some sheep,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and had been hunted by the farmer with long and fruitless diligence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sheep had likewise been destroyed in different quarters; but the owners
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had fixed the imputation of the crime upon dogs, many of whom had atoned
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for their supposed offences by their death. He who had mentioned his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovery of panthers received little credit from his neighbours;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,because a long time had elapsed since these animals were supposed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have been exiled from this district, and because no other person had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seen them. The truth of this seemed now to be confirmed by the testimony
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my own senses; but, if the rumour were true, there still existed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,another of these animals, who might harbour in the obscurities of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desert, and against whom it was necessary to employ some precaution.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Henceforth I resolved never to traverse the wilderness unfurnished with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my tomahawk.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These images, mingled with those which the contemplation of futurity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggested, floated, for a time, in my brain, but at length gave place to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sleep.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XIII.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Since my return home, my mind had been fully occupied by schemes and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reflections relative to Clithero. The project suggested by thee, and to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I had determined to devote my leisure, was forgotten, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remembered for a moment and at wide intervals. What, however, was nearly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,banished from my waking thoughts, occurred in an incongruous and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,half-seen form, to my dreams. During my sleep, the image of Waldegrave
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flitted before me. Methought the sentiment that impelled him to visit me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was not affection or complacency, but inquietude and anger. Some service
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or duty remained to be performed by me, which I had culpably neglected:
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to inspirit my zeal, to awaken my remembrance, and incite me to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,performance of this duty, did this glimmering messenger, this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,half-indignant apparition, come.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I commonly awake soon enough to mark the youngest dawn of the morning.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Now, in consequence perhaps of my perturbed sleep, I opened my eyes
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before the stars had lost any of their lustre. This circumstance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,produced some surprise, until the images that lately hovered in my fancy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were recalled, and furnished somewhat like a solution of the problem.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Connected with the image of my dead friend was that of his sister. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discourse that took place at our last interview; the scheme of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,transcribing, for thy use, all the letters which, during his short but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,busy life, I received from him; the nature of this correspondence, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the opportunity which this employment would afford me of contemplating
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these ample and precious monuments of the intellectual existence and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moral pre-eminence of my friend, occurred to my thoughts.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The resolution to prosecute the task was revived. The obligation of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benevolence, with regard to Clithero, was not discharged. This, neither
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,duty nor curiosity would permit to be overlooked or delayed; but why
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should my whole attention and activity be devoted to this man? The hours
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which were spent at home and in my chamber could not be more usefully
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,employed than in making my intended copy.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In a few hours after sunrise I purposed to resume my way to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mountain. Could this interval be appropriated to a better purpose than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in counting over my friend's letters, setting them apart from my own,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and preparing them for that transcription from which I expected so high
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and yet so mournful a gratification?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This purpose, by no violent union, was blended with the recollection of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my dream. This recollection infused some degree of wavering and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dejection into my mind. In transcribing these letters I should violate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pathetic and solemn injunctions frequently repeated by the writer. Was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,there some connection between this purpose and the incidents of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vision? Was the latter sent to enforce the interdictions which had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,formerly imposed?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thou art not fully acquainted with the intellectual history of thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brother. Some information on that head will be necessary to explain the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nature of that reluctance which I now feel to comply with thy request,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and which had formerly so much excited thy surprise.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Waldegrave, like other men early devoted to meditation and books, had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,adopted, at different periods, different systems of opinion on topics
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,connected with religion and morals. His earliest creeds tended to efface
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the impressions of his education; to deify necessity and universalize
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,matter; to destroy the popular distinctions between soul and body, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to dissolve the supposed connection between the moral condition of man
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,anterior and subsequent to death.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This creed he adopted with all the fulness of conviction, and propagated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with the utmost zeal. Soon after our friendship commenced, fortune
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,placed us at a distance from each other, and no intercourse was allowed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but by the pen. Our letters, however, were punctual and copious. Those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of Waldegrave were too frequently devoted to the defence of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,favourite tenets.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thou art acquainted with the revolution that afterwards took place in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his mind. Placed within the sphere of religious influence, and listening
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,daily to the reasonings and exhortations of Mr. S----, whose benign
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,temper and blameless deportment was a visible and constant lesson, he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,insensibly resumed the faith which he had relinquished, and became the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vehement opponent of all that he had formerly defended. The chief object
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his labours, in this new state of his mind, was to counteract the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,effect of his former reasonings on my opinions.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At this time, other changes took place in his situation, in consequence
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of which we were once more permitted to reside under the same roof. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intercourse now ceased to be by letter, and the subtle and laborious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,argumentations which he had formerly produced against religion, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which were contained in a permanent form, were combated in transient
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conversation. He was not only eager to subvert those opinions which he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had contributed to instil into me, but was anxious that the letters and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,manuscripts which had been employed in their support should be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destroyed. He did not fear wholly or chiefly on my own account. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,believed that the influence of former reasonings on my faith would be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficiently eradicated by the new; but he dreaded lest these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,manuscripts might fall into other hands, and thus produce mischiefs
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which it would not be in his power to repair. With regard to me, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,poison had been followed by its antidote; but with respect to others,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these letters would communicate the poison when the antidote could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be administered.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I would not consent to this sacrifice. I did not entirely abjure the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,creed which had, with great copiousness and eloquence, been defended in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these letters. Besides, mixed up with abstract reasonings were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,numberless passages which elucidated the character and history of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friend. These were too precious to be consigned to oblivion; and to take
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them out of their present connection and arrangement would be to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mutilate and deform them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His entreaties and remonstrances were earnest and frequent, but always
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ineffectual. He had too much purity of motives to be angry at my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stubbornness; but his sense of the mischievous tendency of these letters
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was so great, that my intractability cost him many a pang.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He was now gone, and I had not only determined to preserve these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,monuments, but had consented to copy them for the use of another; for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the use of one whose present and eternal welfare had been the chief
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,object of his cares and efforts. Thou, like others of thy sex, art
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unaccustomed to metaphysical refinements. Thy religion is the growth of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sensibility and not of argument. Thou art not fortified and prepossessed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,against the subtleties with which the being and attributes of the Deity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have been assailed. Would it be just to expose thee to pollution and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depravity from this source? To make thy brother the instrument of thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,apostasy, the author of thy fall? That brother whose latter days were so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ardently devoted to cherishing the spirit of devotion in thy heart?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These ideas now occurred with more force than formerly. I had promised,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not without reluctance, to give thee the entire copy of his letters; but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now receded from this promise. I resolved merely to select for thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perusal such as were narrative or descriptive. This could not be done
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with too much expedition. It was still dark, but my sleep was at an end,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, by a common apparatus, that lay beside my bed, I could instantly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,produce a light.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The light was produced, and I proceeded to the cabinet where all my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,papers and books are deposited. This was my own contrivance and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,workmanship, undertaken by the advice of Sarsefield, who took infinite
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pains to foster that mechanical genius which displayed itself so early
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and so forcibly in thy friend. The key belonging to this was, like the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cabinet itself, of singular structure. For greater safety, it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,constantly placed in a closet, which was likewise locked.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The key was found as usual, and the cabinet opened. The letters were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bound together in a compact form, lodged in a parchment case, and placed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in a secret drawer. This drawer would not have been detected by common
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eyes, and it opened by the motion of a spring, of whose existence none
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but the maker was conscious. This drawer I had opened before I went to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sleep, and the letters were then safe.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thou canst not imagine my confusion and astonishment, when, on opening
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the drawer, I perceived that the packet was gone. I looked with more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attention, and put my hand within it; but the space was empty. Whither
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had it gone, and by whom was it purloined? I was not conscious of having
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,taken it away, yet no hands but mine could have done it. On the last
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,evening I had doubtless removed it to some other corner, but had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forgotten it. I tasked my understanding and my memory. I could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conceive the possibility of any motives inducing me to alter my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arrangements in this respect, and was unable to recollect that I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made this change.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What remained? This invaluable relic had disappeared. Every thought and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,every effort must be devoted to the single purpose of regaining it. As
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,yet I did not despair. Until I had opened and ransacked every part of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cabinet in vain, I did not admit the belief that I had lost it. Even
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,then this persuasion was tumultuous and fluctuating. It had vanished to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my senses, but these senses were abused and depraved. To have passed, of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,its own accord, through the pores of this wood, was impossible; but, if
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it were gone, thus did it escape.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was lost in horror and amazement. I explored every nook a second and a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,third time, but still it eluded my eye and my touch. I opened my closets
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and cases. I pried everywhere, unfolded every article of clothing,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,turned and scrutinized every instrument and tool, but nothing availed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My thoughts were not speedily collected or calmed. I threw myself on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bed and resigned myself to musing. That my loss was irretrievable was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supposition not to be endured. Yet ominous terrors haunted me,--a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whispering intimation that a relic which I valued more than life was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,torn forever away by some malignant and inscrutable destiny. The same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,power that had taken it from this receptacle was able to waft it over
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the ocean or the mountains, and condemn me to a fruitless and eternal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,search.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But what was he that committed the theft? Thou only, of the beings who
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,live, wast acquainted with the existence of these manuscripts. Thou art
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,many miles distant, and art utterly a stranger to the mode or place of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their concealment. Not only access to the cabinet, but access to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,room, without my knowledge and permission, was impossible. Both were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,locked during this night. Not five hours had elapsed since the cabinet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and drawer had been opened, and since the letters had been seen and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,touched, being in their ordinary position. During this interval, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thief had entered, and despoiled me of my treasure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This event, so inexplicable and so dreadful, threw my soul into a kind
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of stupor or distraction, from which I was suddenly roused by a footstep
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,softly moving in the entry near my door. I started from my bed, as if I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had gained a glimpse of the robber. Before I could run to the door, some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,one knocked. I did not think upon the propriety of answering the signal,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but hastened with tremulous fingers and throbbing heart to open the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,door. My uncle, in his night-dress, and apparently just risen from his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bed, stood before me!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He marked the eagerness and perturbation of my looks, and inquired into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cause. I did not answer his inquiries. His appearance in my chamber
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and in this guise added to my surprise. My mind was full of the late
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovery, and instantly conceived some connection between this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unseasonable visit and my lost manuscript. I interrogated him in my turn
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as to the cause of his coming.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Why," said he, "I came to ascertain whether it was you or not who
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,amused himself so strangely at this time of night. What is the matter
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with you? Why are you up so early?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I told him that I had been roused by my dreams, and, finding no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inclination to court my slumber back again, I had risen, though earlier
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by some hours than the usual period of my rising.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"But why did you go up-stairs? You might easily imagine that the sound
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of your steps would alarm those below, who would be puzzled to guess who
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it was that had thought proper to amuse himself in this manner."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Up-stairs? I have not left my room this night. It is not ten minutes
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,since I awoke, and my door has not since been opened."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Indeed! That is strange. Nay, it is impossible! It was your feet surely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I heard pacing so solemnly and indefatigably across the _long
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,room_ for near an hour. I could not for my life conjecture, for a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time, who it was, but finally concluded that it was you. There was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,still, however, some doubt, and I came hither to satisfy myself."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These tidings were adapted to raise all my emotions to a still higher
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pitch. I questioned him with eagerness as to the circumstances he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,noticed. He said he had been roused by a sound, whose power of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disturbing him arose, not from its loudness, but from its uncommonness.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He distinctly heard some one pacing to and fro with bare feet, in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,long room: this sound continued, with little intermission, for an hour.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He then noticed a cessation of the walking, and a sound as if some one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were lifting the lid of the large cedar chest that stood in the corner
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of this room. The walking was not resumed, and all was silent. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,listened for a quarter of an hour, and busied himself in conjecturing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cause of this disturbance. The most probable conclusion was, that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the walker was his nephew, and his curiosity had led him to my chamber
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to ascertain the truth.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This dwelling has three stories. The two lower stories are divided into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,numerous apartments. The upper story constitutes a single room whose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sides are the four walls of the house, and whose ceiling is the roof.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This room is unoccupied, except by lumber, and imperfectly lighted by a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,small casement at one end. In this room were footsteps heard by my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uncle.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The staircase leading to it terminated in a passage near my door. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,snatched the candle, and, desiring him to follow me, added that I would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascertain the truth in a moment. He followed, but observed that the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,walking had ceased long enough for the person to escape.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I ascended to the room, and looked behind and among the tables, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chairs, and casks, which were confusedly scattered through it, but found
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing in the shape of man. The cedar chest, spoken of by Mr. Huntly,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contained old books, and remnants of maps and charts, whose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,worthlessness unfitted them for accomodation elsewhere. The lid was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without hinges or lock. I examined this repository, but there was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing which attracted my attention.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The way between the kitchen-door and the door of the long room had no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impediments. Both were usually unfastened; but the motives by which any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stranger to the dwelling, or indeed any one within it, could be prompted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to choose this place and hour for an employment of this kind, were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wholly incomprehensible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,When the family rose, inquiries were made; but no satisfaction was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obtained. The family consisted only of four persons,--my uncle, my two
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sisters, and myself. I mentioned to them the loss I had sustained, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their conjectures were no less unsatisfactory on this than on the former
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incident.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was no end to my restless meditations. Waldegrave was the only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being, besides myself, acquainted with the secrets of my cabinet. During
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his life these manuscripts had been the objects of perpetual solicitude;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to gain possession, to destroy or secrete them, was the strongest of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wishes. Had he retained his sensibility on the approach of death, no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,doubt he would have renewed, with irresistible solemnity, his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,injunctions to destroy them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Now, however, they had vanished. There were no materials of conjecture;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no probabilities to be weighed, or suspicions to revolve. Human artifice
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or power was unequal to this exploit. Means less than preternatural
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would not furnish a conveyance for this treasure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was otherwise with regard to this unseasonable walker. His
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inducements indeed were beyond my power to conceive; but to enter these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,doors and ascend these stairs demanded not the faculties of any being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more than human.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This intrusion, and the pillage of my cabinet, were contemporary events.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Was there no more connection between them than that which results from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time? Was not the purloiner of my treasure and the wanderer the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,person? I could not reconcile the former incident with the attributes of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,man; and yet a secret faith, not to be outrooted or suspended, swayed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me, and compelled me to imagine that the detection of this visitant
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would unveil the thief.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These thoughts were pregnant with dejection and reverie. Clithero,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,during the day, was forgotten. On the succeeding night, my intentions,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with regard to this man, returned. I derived some slender consolation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from reflecting, that time, in its long lapse and ceaseless revolutions,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might dissipate the gloom that environed me. Meanwhile, I struggled to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dismiss the images connected with my loss and to think only of Clithero.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My impatience was as strong as ever to obtain another interview with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this man. I longed with vehemence for the return of day. I believed that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,every moment added to his sufferings, intellectual and physical, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confided in the efficacy of my presence to alleviate or suspend them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The provisions I had left would be speedily consumed, and the abstinence
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of three days was sufficient to undermine the vital energies. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sometimes hesitated whether I ought not instantly to depart. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,night indeed, but the late storm had purified the air, and the radiance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of a full moon was universal and dazzling.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,From this attempt I was deterred by reflecting that my own frame needed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the repairs of sleep. Toil and watchfulness, if prolonged another day,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would deeply injure a constitution by no means distinguished for its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,force. I must, therefore, compel, if it were possible, some hours of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repose. I prepared to retire to bed, when a new incident occurred to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,divert my attention for a time from these designs.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XIV.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,While sitting alone by the parlour-fire, marking the effects of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moonlight, I noted one on horseback coming towards the gate. At first
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sight, methought his shape and guise were not wholly new to me; but all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I could discern was merely a resemblance to some one whom I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before seen. Presently he stopped, and, looking towards the house, made
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inquiries of a passenger who chanced to be near. Being apparently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,satisfied with the answers he received, he rode with a quick pace into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the court and alighted at the door. I started from my seat, and, going
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forth, waited with some impatience to hear his purpose explained.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He accosted me with the formality of a stranger, and asked if a young
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,man, by name Edgar Huntly, resided here. Being answered in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,affirmative, and being requested to come in, he entered, and seated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,himself, without hesitation, by the fire. Some doubt and anxiety were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,visible in his looks. He seemed desirous of information upon some topic,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and yet betrayed terror lest the answers he might receive should subvert
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some hope or confirm some foreboding.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Meanwhile I scrutinized his features with much solicitude. A nearer and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more deliberate view convinced me that the first impression was just;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but still I was unable to call up his name or the circumstances of our
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,former meeting. The pause was at length ended by his saying, in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,faltering voice,--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My name is Weymouth. I came hither to obtain information on a subject
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in which my happiness is deeply concerned."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At the mention of his name, I started. It was a name too closely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,connected with the image of thy brother, not to call up affecting and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vivid recollections. Weymouth, thou knowest, was thy brother's friend.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It is three years since this man left America, during which time no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tidings had been heard of him,--at least, by thy brother. He had now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,returned, and was probably unacquainted with the fate of his friend.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,After an anxious pause, he continued:--"Since my arrival I have heard of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an event which has, on many accounts, given me the deepest sorrow. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,loved Waldegrave, and know not any person in the world whose life was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dearer to me than his. There were considerations, however, which made it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more precious to me than the life of one whose merits might be greater.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,With his life, my own existence and property were, I have reason to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,think, inseparably united.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"On my return to my country, after a long absence, I made immediate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inquiries after him. I was informed of his untimely death. I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,questions, of infinite moment to my happiness, to decide with regard to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the state and disposition of his property. I sought out those of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friends who had maintained with him the most frequent and confidential
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intercourse, but they could not afford me any satisfaction. At length, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was informed that a young man of your name, and living in this district,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had enjoyed more of his affection and society than any other, had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regulated the property which he left behind, and was best qualified to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,afford the intelligence which I sought. You, it seems, are this person,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and of you I must make inquiries to which I conjure you to return
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sincere and explicit answers."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"That," said I, "I shall find no difficulty in doing. Whatever questions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you shall think proper to ask, I will answer with readiness and truth."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What kind of property, and to what amount, was your friend possessed of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at his death?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"It was money, and consisted of deposits at the Bank of North America.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The amount was little short of eight thousand dollars."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"On whom has this property devolved?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"His sister was his only kindred, and she is now in possession of it."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Did he leave any will by which he directed the disposition of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,property?" While thus speaking, Weymouth fixed his eyes upon my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,countenance, and seemed anxious to pierce into my inmost soul. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,somewhat surprised at his questions, but much more at the manner in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which they were put. I answered him, however, without delay:--"He left
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no will, nor was any paper discovered by which we could guess at his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intentions. No doubt, indeed, had he made a will, his sister would have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been placed precisely in the same condition in which she now is. He was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not only bound to her by the strongest ties of kindred, but by affection
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and gratitude."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Weymouth now withdrew his eyes from my face, and sunk into a mournful
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reverie. He sighed often and deeply. This deportment and the strain of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his inquiries excited much surprise. His interest in the fate of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Waldegrave ought to have made the information he had received a source
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of satisfaction rather than of regret. The property which Waldegrave
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,left was much greater than his mode of life and his own professions had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,given us reason to expect, but it was no more than sufficient to insure
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to thee an adequate subsistence. It ascertained the happiness of those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who were dearest to Waldegrave, and placed them forever beyond the reach
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of that poverty which had hitherto beset them. I made no attempt to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interrupt the silence, but prepared to answer any new interrogatory. At
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length, Weymouth resumed:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Waldegrave was a fortunate man to amass so considerable a sum in so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,short a time. I remember, when we parted, he was poor. He used to lament
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that his scrupulous integrity precluded him from all the common roads to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wealth. He did not contemn riches, but he set the highest value upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,competence, and imagined that he was doomed forever to poverty. His
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,religious duty compelled him to seek his livelihood by teaching a school
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of blacks. The labour was disproportioned to his feeble constitution,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the profit was greatly disproportioned to the labour. It scarcely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supplied the necessities of nature, and was reduced sometimes even below
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that standard by his frequent indisposition. I rejoice to find that his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scruples had somewhat relaxed their force, and that he had betaken
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,himself to some more profitable occupation. Pray, what was his new way
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of business?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Nay," said I, "his scruples continued as rigid, in this respect, as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ever. He was teacher of the negro freeschool when he died."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Indeed! How, then, came he to amass so much money? Could he blend any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more lucrative pursuit with his duty as a schoolmaster?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"So it seems."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What was his pursuit?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"That question, I believe, none of his friends are qualified to answer.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I thought myself acquainted with the most secret transactions of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life, but this had been carefully concealed from me. I was not only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unapprized of any other employment of his time, but had not the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,slightest suspicion of his possessing any property besides his clothes
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and books. Ransacking his papers, with a different view, I lighted on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his bank-book, in which was a regular receipt for seven thousand five
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hundred dollars. By what means he acquired this money, and even the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acquisition of it, till his death put us in possession of his papers,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was wholly unknown to us."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Possibly he might have held it in trust for another. In this case some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,memorandums or letters would be found explaining this affair."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"True. This supposition could not fail to occur, in consequence of which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the most diligent search was made among his papers, but no shred or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scrap was to be found which countenanced our conjecture."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"You may reasonably be surprised, and perhaps offended," said Weymouth,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"at these inquiries; but it is time to explain my motives for making
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them. Three years ago I was, like Waldegrave, indigent, and earned my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bread by daily labour. During seven years' service in a public office, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,saved, from the expenses of subsistence, a few hundred dollars. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,determined to strike into a new path, and, with this sum, to lay the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,foundation of better fortune. I turned it into a bulky commodity,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,freighted and loaded a small vessel, and went with it to Barcelona in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Spain. I was not unsuccessful in my projects, and, changing my abode to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,England, France, and Germany, according as my interest required, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,became finally possessed of sufficient for the supply of all my wants. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,then resolved to return to my native country, and, laying out my money
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in land, to spend the rest of my days in the luxury and quiet of an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opulent farmer. For this end I invested the greatest part of my property
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in a cargo of wine from Madeira. The remainder I turned into a bill of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exchange for seven thousand five hundred dollars. I had maintained a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friendly correspondence with Waldegrave during my absence. There was no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,one with whom I had lived on terms of so much intimacy, and had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,boundless confidence in his integrity. To him therefore I determined to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,transmit this bill, requesting him to take the money into safe-keeping
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,until my return. In this manner I endeavoured to provide against the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accidents that might befall my person or my cargo in crossing the ocean.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"It was my fate to encounter the worst of these disasters. We were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,overtaken by a storm, my vessel was driven ashore on the coast of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Portugal, my cargo was utterly lost, and the greater part of the crew
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and passengers were drowned. I was rescued from the same fate by some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fishermen. In consequence of the hardships to which I had been exposed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,having laboured for several days at the pumps, and spent the greater
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,part of a winter night hanging from the rigging of the ship and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perpetually beaten by the waves, I contracted a severe disease, which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bereaved me of the use of my limbs. The fishermen who rescued me carried
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me to their huts, and there I remained three weeks helpless and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,miserable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"That part of the coast on which I was thrown was, in the highest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,degree, sterile and rude. Its few inhabitants subsisted precariously on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the produce of the ocean. Their dwellings were of mud,--low, filthy,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dark, and comfortless. Their fuel was the stalks of shrubs sparingly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scattered over a sandy desert. Their poverty scarcely allowed them salt
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and black bread with their fish, which was obtained in unequal and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sometimes insufficient quantities, and which they ate with all its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impurities, and half cooked.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My former habits, as well as my present indisposition, required very
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,different treatment from what the ignorance and penury of these people
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obliged them to bestow. I lay upon the moist earth, imperfectly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sheltered from the sky, and with neither raiment nor fire to keep me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,warm. My hosts had little attention or compassion to spare to the wants
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of others. They could not remove me to a more hospitable district; and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,here, without doubt, I should have perished, had not a monk chanced to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,visit their hovels. He belonged to a convent of St. Jago, some leagues
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,farther from the shore, which used to send one of its members annually
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to inspect the religious concerns of those outcasts. Happily, this was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the period of their visitations.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My abode in Spain had made me somewhat conversant with its language.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The dialect of this monk did not so much differ from Castilian but that,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with the assistance of Latin, we were able to converse. The jargon of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the fishermen was unintelligible, and they had vainly endeavoured to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,keep up my spirits by informing me of this expected visit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This monk was touched with compassion at my calamity, and speedily
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,provided the means of my removal to his convent. Here I was charitably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entertained, and the aid of a physician was procured for me. He was but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,poorly skilled in his profession, and rather confirmed than alleviated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my disease. The Portuguese of his trade, especially in remoter
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,districts, are little more than dealers in talismans and nostrums. For a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,long time I was unable to leave my pallet, and had no prospect before me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but that of consuming my days in the gloom of this cloister.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"All the members of this convent but he who had been my first
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benefactor, and whose name was Chaledro, were bigoted and sordid. Their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chief motive for treating me with kindness was the hope of obtaining a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,convert from heresy. They spared no pains to subdue my errors, and were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,willing to prolong my imprisonment, in the hope of finally gaining their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,end. Had my fate been governed by those, I should have been immured in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this convent, and compelled either to adopt their fanatical creed or to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,put an end to my own life, in order to escape their well-meant
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,persecutions. Chaledro, however, though no less sincere in his faith and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,urgent in his entreaties, yet finding me invincible, exerted his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,influence to obtain my liberty.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"After many delays, and strenuous exertions of my friend, they consented
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to remove me to Oporto. The journey was to be performed in an open cart,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,over a mountainous country, in the heats of summer. The monks
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,endeavoured to dissuade me from the enterprise, for my own sake, it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being scarcely possible that one in my feeble state should survive a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,journey like this; but I despaired of improving my condition by other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means. I preferred death to the imprisonment of a Portuguese monastery,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and knew that I could hope for no alleviation of my disease but from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,skill of Scottish or French physicians, whom I expected to meet with in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that city. I adhered to my purpose with so much vehemence and obstinacy,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that they finally yielded to my wishes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My road lay through the wildest and most rugged districts. It did not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exceed ninety miles, but seven days were consumed on the way. The motion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the vehicle racked me with the keenest pangs, and my attendants
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,concluded that every stage would be my last. They had been selected
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without due regard to their characters. They were knavish and inhuman,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and omitted nothing but actual violence to hasten my death. They
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,purposely retarded the journey, and protracted to seven what might have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been readily performed in four days. They neglected to execute the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,orders which they had received respecting my lodging and provisions; and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from them, as well as from the peasants, who were sure to be informed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I was a heretic, I suffered every species of insult and injury. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,constitution, as well as my frame, possessed a fund of strength of which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had no previous conception. In spite of hardship, and exposure, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,abstinence, I at last arrived at Oporto.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Instead of being carried, agreeably to Chaledro's direction, to a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,convent of St. Jago, I was left, late in the evening, in the porch of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,common hospital. My attendants, having laid me on the pavement and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,loaded me with imprecations, left me to obtain admission by my own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,efforts. I passed the livelong night in this spot, and in the morning
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was received into the house in a state which left it uncertain whether I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was alive or dead.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"After recovering my sensibility, I made various efforts to procure a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,visit from some English merchant. This was no easy undertaking for one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in my deplorable condition. I was too weak to articulate my words
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinctly, and these words were rendered, by my foreign accent,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scarcely intelligible. The likelihood of my speedy death made the people
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,about me more indifferent to my wants and petitions.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I will not dwell upon my repeated disappointments, but content myself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with mentioning that I gained the attention of a French gentleman whose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,curiosity brought him to view the hospital. Through him I obtained a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,visit from an English merchant, and finally gained the notice of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,person who formerly resided in America, and of whom I had imperfect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowledge. By their kindness I was removed from the hospital to a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,private house. A Scottish surgeon was summoned to my assistance, and in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seven months I was restored to my present state of health.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"At Oporto, I embarked, in an American ship, for New York. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destitute of all property, and relied, for the payment of the debts
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I was obliged to contract, as well as for my future subsistence,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on my remittance to Waldegrave. I hastened to Philadelphia, and was soon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,informed that my friend was dead. His death had taken place a long time
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,since my remittance to him: hence this disaster was a subject of regret
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chiefly on his own account. I entertained no doubt but that my property
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been secured, and that either some testamentary directions or some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,papers had been left behind respecting this affair.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I sought out those who were formerly our mutual acquaintance. I found
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that they were wholly strangers to his affairs. They could merely relate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some particulars of his singular death, and point out the lodgings which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he formerly occupied. Hither I forthwith repaired, and discovered that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he lived in this house with his sister, disconnected with its other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inhabitants. They described his mode of life in terms that showed them
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to be very imperfectly acquainted with it. It was easy indeed to infer,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from their aspect and manners, that little sympathy or union could have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subsisted between them and their co-tenants; and this inference was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confirmed by their insinuations, the growth of prejudice and envy. They
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,told me that Waldegrave's sister had gone to live in the country, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whither, or for how long, she had not condescended to inform them, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they did not care to ask. She was a topping dame, whose notions were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,much too high for her station; who was more nice than wise, and yet was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,one who could stoop when it most became her to stand upright. It was no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,business of theirs; but they could not but mention their suspicions that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,she had good reasons for leaving the city and for concealing the place
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her retreat. Some things were hard to be disguised. They spoke for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,themselves, and the only way to hinder disagreeable discoveries was to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,keep out of sight.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I was wholly a stranger to Waldegrave's sister. I knew merely that he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had such a relation. There was nothing, therefore, to outbalance this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unfavourable report, but the apparent malignity and grossness of those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who gave it. It was not, however, her character about which I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solicitous, but merely the place where she might be found and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suitable inquiries respecting her deceased brother be answered. On this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,head, these people professed utter ignorance, and were either unable or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unwilling to direct me to any person in the city who knew more than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,themselves. After much discourse, they, at length, let fall an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intimation that, if any one knew her place of retreat, it was probably a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,country-lad, by name Huntly, who lived near the _Forks_ of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Delaware. After Waldegrave's death this lad had paid his sister a visit,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and seemed to be admitted on a very confidential footing. She left the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,house, for the last time, in his company, and he, therefore, was most
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,likely to know what had become of her.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The name of Huntly was not totally unknown to me. I myself was born and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brought up in the neighbouring township of Chetasco. I had some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowledge of your family, and your name used often to be mentioned by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Waldegrave as that of one who, at a maturer age, would prove himself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,useful to his country. I determined, therefore, to apply to you for what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,information you could give. I designed to visit my father, who lives in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chetasco, and relieve him from that disquiet which his ignorance of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fate could not fail to have inspired, and both these ends could be thus,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at the same time, accomplished.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Before I left the city, I thought it proper to apply to the merchant on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom my bill had been drawn. If this bill had been presented and paid,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he had doubtless preserved some record of it, and hence a clue might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,afforded, though every other expedient should fail. My usual ill fortune
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pursued me upon this occasion; for the merchant had lately become
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,insolvent, and, to avoid the rage of his creditors, had fled, without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,leaving any vestige of this or similar transactions behind him. He had,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some years since, been an adventurer from Holland, and was suspected to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have returned thither."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XV.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I came hither with a heart desponding of success. Adversity had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,weakened my faith in the promises of the future, and I was prepared to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,receive just such tidings as you have communicated. Unacquainted with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the secret motives of Waldegrave and his sister, it is impossible for me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to weigh the probabilities of their rectitude. I have only my own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assertion to produce in support of my claim. All other evidence, all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vouchers and papers, which might attest my veracity or sanction my claim
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in a court of law, are buried in the ocean. The bill was transmitted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,just before my departure from Madeira, and the letters by which it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accompanied informed Waldegrave of my design to follow it immediately.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Hence he did not, it is probable, acknowledge the receipt of my letters.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The vessels in which they were sent arrived in due season. I was assured
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that all letters were duly deposited in the post-office, where, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,present, mine are not to be found.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"You assure me that nothing has been found among his papers, hinting at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,any pecuniary transaction between him and me. Some correspondence passed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,between us previous to that event. Have no letters, with my signature,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been found? Are you qualified, by your knowledge of his papers, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,answer me explicitly? Is it not possible for some letters to have been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mislaid?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I am qualified," said I, "to answer your inquiries beyond any other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,person in the world. Waldegrave maintained only general intercourse with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the rest of mankind. With me his correspondence was copious, and his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confidence, as I imagined, without bounds. His books and papers were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contained in a single chest at his lodgings, the keys of which he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,about him when he died. These keys I carried to his sister, and was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,authorized by her to open and examine the contents of this chest. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was done with the utmost care. These papers are now in my possession.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Among them no paper, of the tenor you mention, was found, and no letter
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with your signature. Neither Mary Waldegrave nor I are capable of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disguising the truth or committing an injustice. The moment she receives
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conviction of your right, she will restore this money to you. The moment
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I imbibe this conviction, I will exert all my influence (and it is not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,small) to induce her to restore it. Permit me, however, to question you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in your turn. Who was the merchant on whom your bill was drawn, what was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the date of it, and when did the bill and its counterparts arrive?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I do not exactly remember the date of the bills. They were made out,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,however, six days before I myself embarked, which happened on the 10th
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of August, 1784. They were sent by three vessels, one of which was bound
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to Charleston and the others to New York. The last arrived within two
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,days of each other, and about the middle of November in the same year.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The name of the payer was Monteith."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,After a pause of recollection, I answered, "I will not hesitate to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,apprize you of every thing which may throw light upon this transaction,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and whether favourable or otherwise to your claim. I have told you,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,among my friend's papers your name is not to be found. I must likewise
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repeat that the possession of this money by Waldegrave was wholly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unknown to us till his death. We are likewise unacquainted with any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means by which he could get possession of so large a sum in his own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,right. He spent no more than his scanty stipend as a teacher, though
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this stipend was insufficient to supply his wants. This bank-receipt is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dated in December, 1784, a fortnight, perhaps, after the date that you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have mentioned. You will perceive how much this coincidence, which could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scarcely have taken place by chance, is favourable to your claim.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Mary Waldegrave resides, at present, at Abingdon. She will rejoice, as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I do, to see one who, as her brother's friend, is entitled to her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,affection. Doubt not but that she will listen with impartiality and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,candour to all that you can urge in defence of your title to this money.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Her decision will not be precipitate, but it will be generous and just,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and founded on such reasons that, even if it be adverse to your wishes,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you will be compelled to approve it?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I can entertain no doubt," he answered, "as to the equity of my claim.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The coincidences you mention are sufficient to convince me that this sum
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was received upon my bill; but this conviction must necessarily be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confined to myself. No one but I can be conscious to the truth of my own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,story. The evidence on which I build my faith, in this case, is that of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my own memory and senses; but this evidence cannot make itself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conspicuous to you. You have nothing but my bare assertion, in addition
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to some probabilities flowing from the conduct of Waldegrave. What facts
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,may exist to corroborate my claim, which you have forgotten, or which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you may think proper to conceal, I cannot judge. I know not what is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passing in the secret of your hearts; I am unacquainted with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,character of this lady and with yours. I have nothing on which to build
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surmises and suspicions of your integrity, and nothing to generate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unusual confidence. The frailty of your virtue and the strength of your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,temptations I know not. However she decides in this case, and whatever
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opinion I shall form as to the reasonableness of her decision, it will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not become me either to upbraid her, or to nourish discontentment and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repinings.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I know that my claim has no legal support; that, if this money be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resigned to me, it will be the impulse of spontaneous justice, and not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the coercion of law, to which I am indebted for it. Since, therefore,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the justice of my claim is to be measured not by law, but by simple
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,equity, I will candidly acknowledge that, as yet, it is uncertain
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whether I ought to receive, even should Miss Waldegrave be willing to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,give it. I know my own necessities and schemes, and in what degree this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,money would be subservient to these; but I know not the views and wants
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of others, and cannot estimate the usefulness of this money to them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,However I decide upon your conduct in withholding or retaining it, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shall make suitable allowance for my imperfect knowledge of your motives
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and wants, as well as for your unavoidable ignorance of mine.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I have related my sufferings from shipwreck and poverty, not to bias
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your judgment or engage your pity, but merely because the impulse to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,relate them chanced to awake; because my heart is softened by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remembrance of Waldegrave, who has been my only friend, and by the sight
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of one whom he loved.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I told you that my father lived in Chetasco. He is now aged, and I am
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his only child. I should have rejoiced in being able to relieve his gray
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hairs from labour to which his failing strength cannot be equal. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was one of my inducements in coming to America. Another was, to prepare
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the way for a woman whom I married in Europe and who is now awaiting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intelligence from me in London. Her poverty is not less than my own, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by marrying against the wishes of her kindred she has bereaved herself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of all support but that of her husband. Whether I shall be able to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rescue her from indigence, whether I shall alleviate the poverty of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,father, or increase it by burdening his scanty friends by my own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maintenance as well as his, the future alone can determine.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I confess that my stock of patience and hope has never been large, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that my misfortunes have nearly exhausted it. The flower of my years has
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been consumed in struggling with adversity, and my constitution has
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,received a shock, from sickness and mistreatment in Portugal, which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cannot expect long to survive. But I make you sad," he continued. "I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have said all that I meant to say in this interview. I am impatient to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,see my father, and night has already come. I have some miles yet to ride
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to his cottage, and over a rough road. I will shortly visit you again,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and talk to you at greater leisure on these and other topics. At present
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I leave you."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was unwilling to part so abruptly with this guest, and entreated him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to prolong his visit; but he would not be prevailed upon. Repeating his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,promise of shortly seeing me again, he mounted his horse and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappeared. I looked after him with affecting and complex emotions. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reviewed the incidents of this unexpected and extraordinary interview,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as if it had existed in a dream. An hour had passed, and this stranger
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had alighted among us as from the clouds, to draw the veil from those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obscurities which had bewildered us so long, to make visible a new train
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of disastrous consequences flowing from the untimely death of thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brother, and to blast that scheme of happiness on which thou and I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,so fondly meditated.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But what wilt thou think of this new-born claim? The story, hadst thou
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,observed the features and guise of the relater, would have won thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,implicit credit. His countenance exhibited deep traces of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,afflictions he had endured, and the fortitude which he had exercised. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was sallow and emaciated, but his countenance was full of seriousness
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and dignity. A sort of ruggedness of brow, the token of great mental
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exertion and varied experience, argued a premature old age.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What a mournful tale! Is such the lot of those who wander from their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rustic homes in search of fortune? Our countrymen are prone to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enterprise, and are scattered over every sea and every land in pursuit
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of that wealth which will not screen them from disease and infirmity,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which is missed much oftener than found, and which, when gained, by no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means compensates them for the hardships and vicissitudes endured in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pursuit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But what if the truth of these pretensions be admitted? The money must
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be restored to its right owner. I know that, whatever inconveniences may
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,follow the deed, thou wilt not hesitate to act justly. Affluence and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dignity, however valuable, may be purchased too dear. Honesty will not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,take away its keenness from the winter blast, its ignominy and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unwholesomeness from servile labour, or strip of its charms the life of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,elegance and leisure; but these, unaccompanied with self-reproach, are
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,less deplorable than wealth and honour the possession of which is marred
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by our own disapprobation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I know the bitterness of this sacrifice. I know the impatience with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which your poverty has formerly been borne; how much your early
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,education is at war with that degradation and obscurity to which your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,youth has been condemned; how earnestly your wishes panted after a state
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which might exempt you from dependence upon daily labour and on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,caprices of others, and might secure to you leisure to cultivate and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indulge your love of knowledge and your social and beneficent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,affections.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Your motive for desiring a change of fortune has been greatly enforced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,since we have become known to each other. Thou hast honoured me with thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,affection; but that union, on which we rely for happiness, could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,take place while both of us were poor. My habits, indeed, have made
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,labour and rustic obscurity less painful than they would prove to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friend, but my present condition is wholly inconsistent with marriage.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As long as my exertions are insufficient to maintain us both, it would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be unjustifiable to burden you with new cares and duties. Of this you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,are more thoroughly convinced than I am. The love of independence and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ease, and impatience of drudgery, are woven into your constitution.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Perhaps they are carried to an erroneous extreme, and derogate from that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uncommon excellence by which your character is, in other respects,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinguished; but they cannot be removed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This obstacle was unexpectedly removed by the death of your brother.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,However justly to be deplored was this catastrophe, yet, like every
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,other event, some of its consequences were good. By giving you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possession of the means of independence and leisure, by enabling us to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,complete a contract which poverty alone had thus long delayed, this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,event has been, at the same time, the most disastrous and propitious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which could have happened.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Why thy brother should have concealed from us the possession of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,money,--why, with such copious means of indulgence and leisure, he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should still pursue his irksome trade, and live in so penurious a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,manner,--has been a topic of endless and unsatisfactory conjecture
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,between us. It was not difficult to suppose that this money was held in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trust for another; but in that case it was unavoidable that some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,document or memorandum, or at least some claimant, would appear. Much
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time has since elapsed, and you have thought yourself at length
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,justified in appropriating this money to your own use.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Our flattering prospects are now shut in. You must return to your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,original poverty, and once more depend for precarious subsistence on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your needle. You cannot restore the whole, for unavoidable expenses and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the change of your mode of living have consumed some part of it. For so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,much you must consider yourself as Weymouth's debtor.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Repine not, my friend, at this unlooked-for reverse. Think upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,merits and misfortunes of your brother's friend; think upon his aged
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,father, whom we shall enable him to rescue from poverty; think upon his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desolate wife, whose merits are, probably, at least equal to your own,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and whose helplessness is likely to be greater. I am not insensible to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the evils which have returned upon us with augmented force, after
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,having, for a moment, taken their flight. I know the precariousness of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my condition and that of my sisters; that our subsistence hangs upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life of an old man. My uncle's death will transfer this property to his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,son, who is a stranger and an enemy to us, and the first act of whose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,authority will unquestionably be to turn us forth from these doors.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Marriage with thee was anticipated with joyous emotions, not merely on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my own account or on thine, but likewise for the sake of those beloved
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,girls to whom that event would enable me to furnish an asylum.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But wedlock is now more distant than ever. Mv heart bleeds to think of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the sufferings which my beloved Mary is again fated to endure; but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regrets are only aggravations of calamity. They are pernicious, and it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,is our duty to shake them off.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I can entertain no doubts as to the equity of Weymouth's claim. So many
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,coincidences could not have happened by chance. The non-appearance of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,any letters or papers connected with it is indeed a mysterious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumstance; but why should Waldegrave be studious of preserving these?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,They were useless paper, and might, without impropriety, be cast away or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made to serve any temporary purpose. Perhaps, indeed, they still lurk in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some unsuspected corner. To wish that time may explain this mystery in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,different manner, and so as to permit our retention of this money, is,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perhaps, the dictate of selfishness. The transfer to Weymouth will not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be productive of less benefit to him and to his family, than we should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,derive from the use of it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These considerations, however, will be weighed when we meet. Meanwhile I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,will return to my narrative.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XVI.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Here, my friend, thou must permit me to pause. The following incidents
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,are of a kind to which the most ardent invention has never conceived a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,parallel. Fortune, in her most wayward mood, could scarcely be suspected
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of an influence like this. The scene was pregnant with astonishment and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,horror. I cannot, even now, recall it without reviving the dismay and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confusion which I then experienced.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Possibly, the period will arrive when I shall look back without agony on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the perils I have undergone. That period is still distant. Solitude and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sleep are now no more than the signals to summon up a tribe of ugly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,phantoms. Famine, and blindness, and death, and savage enemies, never
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fail to be conjured up by the silence and darkness of the night. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cannot dissipate them by any efforts of reason. Sly cowardice requires
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the perpetual consolation of light. My heart droops when I mark the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,decline of the sun, and I never sleep but with a candle burning at my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pillow. If, by any chance, I should awake and find myself immersed in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,darkness, I know not what act of desperation I might be suddenly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impelled to commit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I have delayed this narrative longer than my duty to my friend enjoined.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Now that I am able to hold a pen, I will hasten to terminate that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uncertainty with regard to my fate in which my silence has involved
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thee. I will recall that series of unheard-of and disastrous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vicissitudes which has constituted the latest portion of my life.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I am not certain, however, that I shall relate them in an intelligible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,manner. One image runs into another; sensations succeed in so rapid a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,train, that I fear I shall be unable to distribute and express them with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficient perspicuity. As I look back, my heart is sore, and aches
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,within my bosom. I am conscious to a kind of complex sentiment of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distress and forlornness that cannot be perfectly portrayed by words;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but I must do as well as I can. In the utmost vigour of my faculties, no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eloquence that I possess would do justice to the tale. Now, in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,languishing and feeble state, I shall furnish thee with little more than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a glimpse of the truth. With these glimpses, transient and faint as they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,are, thou must be satisfied.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I have said that I slept. My memory assures me of this; it informs me of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the previous circumstances of my laying aside my clothes, of placing the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,light upon a chair within reach of my pillow, of throwing myself upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the bed, and of gazing on the rays of the moon reflected on the wall and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,almost obscured by those of the candle. I remember my occasional
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,relapses into fits of incoherent fancies, the harbingers of sleep. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remember, as it were, the instant when my thoughts ceased to flow and my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,senses were arrested by the leaden wand of forgetfulness.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My return to sensation and to consciousness took place in no such
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tranquil scene. I emerged from oblivion by degrees so slow and so faint,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that their succession cannot be marked. When enabled at length to attend
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the information which my senses afforded, I was conscious for a time
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of nothing but existence. It was unaccompanied with lassitude or pain,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but I felt disinclined to stretch my limbs or raise my eyelids. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thoughts were wildering and mazy, and, though consciousness was present,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it was disconnected with the locomotive or voluntary power.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,From this state a transition was speedily effected. I perceived that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,posture was supine, and that I lay upon my back. I attempted to open my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eyes. The weight that oppressed them was too great for a slight exertion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to remove. The exertion which I made cost me a pang more acute than any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I ever experienced. My eyes, however, were opened; but the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,darkness that environed me was as intense as before.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I attempted to rise, but my limbs were cold, and my joints had almost
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lost their flexibility. My efforts were repeated, and at length I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attained a sitting posture. I was now sensible of pain in my shoulders
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and back. I was universally in that state to which the frame is reduced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by blows of a club, mercilessly and endlessly repeated; my temples
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,throbbed, and my face was covered with clammy and cold drops: but that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which threw me into deepest consternation was my inability to see. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,turned my head to different quarters; I stretched my eyelids, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exerted every visual energy, but in vain. I was wrapped in the murkiest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and most impenetrable gloom.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The first effort of reflection was to suggest the belief that I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,blind: that disease is known to assail us in a moment and without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,previous warning. This, surely, was the misfortune that had now befallen
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me. Some ray, however fleeting and uncertain, could not fail to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discerned, if the power of vision were not utterly extinguished. In what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumstances could I possibly be placed, from which every particle of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,light should, by other means, be excluded?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This led my thoughts into a new train. I endeavoured to recall the past;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but the past was too much in contradiction to the present, and my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intellect was too much shattered by external violence, to allow me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accurately to review it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Since my sight availed nothing to the knowledge of my condition, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,betook myself to other instruments. The element which I breathed was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stagnant and cold. The spot where I lay was rugged and hard. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,neither naked nor clothed: a shirt and trousers composed my dress, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the shoes and stockings, which always accompanied these, were now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wanting. What could I infer from this scanty garb, this chilling
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,atmosphere, this stony bed?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had awakened as from sleep. What was my condition when I fell asleep?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Surely it was different from the present. Then I inhabited a lightsome
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chamber and was stretched upon a down bed; now I was supine upon a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rugged surface and immersed in palpable obscurity. Then I was in perfect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,health; now my frame was covered with bruises and every joint was racked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with pain. What dungeon or den had received me, and by whose command was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I transported hither?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,After various efforts I stood upon my feet. At first I tottered and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,staggered. I stretched out my hands on all sides, but met only with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vacuity. I advanced forward. At the third step my foot moved something
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which lay upon the ground: I stooped and took it up, and found, on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,examination, that it was an Indian tomahawk. This incident afforded me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no hint from which I might conjecture my state.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Proceeding irresolutely and slowly forward, my hands at length touched a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wall. This, like the flooring, was of stone, and was rugged and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impenetrable. I followed this wall. An advancing angle occurred at a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,short distance, which was followed by similar angles. I continued to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,explore this clue, till the suspicion occurred that I was merely going
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,round the walls of a vast and irregular apartment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The utter darkness disabled me from comparing directions and distances.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This discovery, therefore, was not made on a sudden, and was still
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entangled with some doubt. My blood recovered some warmth, and my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,muscles some elasticity; but in proportion as my sensibility returned,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my pains augmented. Overpowered by my fears and my agonies, I desisted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from my fruitless search, and sat down, supporting my back against the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wall.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My excruciating sensations for a time occupied my attention. These, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,combination with other causes, gradually produced a species of delirium.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I existed, as it were, in a wakeful dream. With nothing to correct my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,erroneous perceptions, the images of the past occurred in capricious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,combinations and vivid hues. Methought I was the victim of some tyrant
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who had thrust me into a dungeon of his fortress, and left me no power
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to determine whether he intended I should perish with famine, or linger
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,out a long life in hopeless imprisonment. Whether the day was shut out
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by insuperable walls, or the darkness that surrounded me was owing to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the night and to the smallness of those crannies through which daylight
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was to be admitted, I conjectured in vain.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sometimes I imagined myself buried alive. Methought I had fallen into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seeming death, and my friends had consigned me to the tomb, from which a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resurrection was impossible. That, in such a case, my limbs would have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been confined to a coffin, and my coffin to a grave, and that I should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instantly have been suffocated, did not occur to destroy my supposition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Neither did this supposition overwhelm me with terror or prompt my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,efforts at deliverance. My state was full of tumult and confusion, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my attention was incessantly divided between my painful sensations and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my feverish dreams.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There is no standard by which time can be measured but the succession of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,our thoughts and the changes that take place in the external world. From
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the latter I was totally excluded. The former made the lapse of some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hours appear like the tediousness of weeks and months. At length, a new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sensation recalled my rambling meditations, and gave substance to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fears. I now felt the cravings of hunger, and perceived that, unless my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deliverance were speedily effected, I must suffer a tedious and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lingering death.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I once more tasked my understanding and my senses to discover the nature
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my present situation and the means of escape. I listened to catch
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some sound. I heard an unequal and varying echo, sometimes near and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sometimes distant, sometimes dying away and sometimes swelling into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,loudness. It was unlike any thing I had before heard, but it was evident
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that it arose from wind sweeping through spacious halls and winding
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passages. These tokens were incompatible with the result of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,examination I had made. If my hands were true, I was immured between
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,walls through which there was no avenue.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now exerted my voice, and cried as loud as my wasted strength would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,admit. Its echoes were sent back to me in broken and confused sounds and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from above. This effort was casual, but some part of that uncertainty in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I was involved was instantly dispelled by it. In passing through
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cavern on the former day, I have mentioned the verge of the pit at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I arrived. To acquaint me as far as was possible with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dimensions of the place, I had hallooed with all my force, knowing that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sound is reflected according to the distance and relative positions of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the substances from which it is repelled.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The effect produced by my voice on this occasion resembled, with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remarkable exactness, the effect which was then produced. Was I, then,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shut up in the same cavern? Had I reached the brink of the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precipice and been thrown headlong into that vacuity? Whence else could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arise the bruises which I had received, but from my fall? Yet all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remembrance of my journey hither was lost. I had determined to explore
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this cave on the ensuing day, but my memory informed me not that this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intention had been carried into effect. Still, it was only possible to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conclude that I had come hither on my intended expedition, and had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thrown by another, or had, by some ill chance, fallen, into the pit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This opinion was conformable to what I had already observed. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pavement and walls were rugged like those of the footing and sides of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cave through which I had formerly passed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But if this were true, what was the abhorred catastrophe to which I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now reserved? The sides of this pit were inaccessible; human footsteps
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would never wander into these recesses. My friends were unapprized of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forlorn state. Here I should continue till wasted by famine. In this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grave should I linger out a few days in unspeakable agonies, and then
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perish forever.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The inroads of hunger were already experienced; and this knowledge of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the desperateness of my calamity urged me to frenzy. I had none but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,capricious and unseen fate to condemn. The author of my distress, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the means he had taken to decoy me hither, were incomprehensible. Surely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my senses were fettered or depraved by some spell. I was still asleep,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and this was merely a tormenting vision; or madness had seized me, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the darkness that environed and the hunger that afflicted me existed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,only in my own distempered imagination.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The consolation of these doubts could not last long. Every hour added to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the proof that my perceptions were real. My hunger speedily became
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ferocious. I tore the linen of my shirt between my teeth and swallowed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the fragments. I felt a strong propensity to bite the flesh from my arm.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My heart overflowed with cruelty, and I pondered on the delight I should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,experience in rending some living animal to pieces, and drinking its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,blood and grinding its quivering fibres between my teeth.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This agony had already passed beyond the limits of endurance. I saw that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time, instead of bringing respite or relief, would only aggravate my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wants, and that my only remaining hope was to die before I should be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assaulted by the last extremes of famine. I now recollected that a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tomahawk was at hand, and rejoiced in the possession of an instrument by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I could so effectually terminate my sufferings.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I took it in my hand, moved its edge over my fingers, and reflected on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the force that was required to make it reach my heart. I investigated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the spot where it should enter, and strove to fortify myself with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resolution to repeat the stroke a second or third time, if the first
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should prove insufficient. I was sensible that I might fail to inflict a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mortal wound, but delighted to consider that the blood which would be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made to flow would finally release me, and that meanwhile my pains would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be alleviated by swallowing this blood.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You will not wonder that I felt some reluctance to employ so fatal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,though indispensable a remedy. I once more ruminated on the possibility
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of rescuing myself by other means. I now reflected that the upper
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,termination of the wall could not be at an immeasurable distance from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the pavement. I had fallen from a height; but if that height had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,considerable, instead of being merely bruised, should I not have been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dashed into pieces?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Gleams of hope burst anew upon my soul. Was it not possible, I asked, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reach the top of this pit? The sides were rugged and uneven. Would not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their projectures and abruptnesses serve me as steps by which I might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascend in safety? This expedient was to be tried without delay. Shortly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my strength would fail, and my doom would be irrevocably sealed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I will not enumerate my laborious efforts, my alternations of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,despondency and confidence, the eager and unwearied scrutiny with which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I examined the surface, the attempts which I made, and the failures
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which, for a time, succeeded each other. A hundred times, when I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascended some feet from the bottom, I was compelled to relinquish my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,undertaking by the _untenable_ smoothness of the spaces which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remained to be gone over. A hundred times I threw myself, exhausted by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fatigue and my pains, on the ground. The consciousness was gradually
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,restored that, till I had attempted every part of the wall, it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,absurd to despair, and I again drew my tottering limbs and aching joints
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to that part of the wall which had not been surveyed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At length, as I stretched my hand upward, I found somewhat that seemed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,like a recession in the wall. It was possible that this was the top of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cavity, and this might be the avenue to liberty. My heart leaped
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with joy, and I proceeded to climb the wall. No undertaking could be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conceived more arduous than this. The space between this verge and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,floor was nearly smooth. The verge was higher from the bottom than my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,head. The only means of ascending that were offered me were by my hands,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with which I could draw myself upward so as, at length, to maintain my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hold with my feet.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My efforts were indefatigable, and at length I placed myself on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,verge. When this was accomplished, my strength was nearly gone. Had I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not found space enough beyond this brink to stretch myself at length, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should unavoidably have fallen backward into the pit, and all my pains
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had served no other end than to deepen my despair and hasten my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destruction.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What impediments and perils remained to be encountered I could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,judge. I was now inclined to forebode the worst. The interval of repose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which was necessary to be taken, in order to recruit my strength, would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accelerate the ravages of famine, and leave me without the power to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,proceed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In this state, I once more consoled myself that an instrument of death
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was at hand. I had drawn up with me the tomahawk, being sensible that,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should this impediment be overcome, others might remain that would prove
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,insuperable. Before I employed it, however, I cast my eyes wildly and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,languidly around. The darkness was no less intense than in the pit
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,below, and yet two objects were distinctly seen.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,They resembled a fixed and obscure flame. They were motionless. Though
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lustrous themselves, they created no illumination around them. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumstance, added to others, which reminded me of similar objects
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,noted on former occasions, immediately explained the nature of what I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beheld. These were the eyes of a panther.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus had I struggled to obtain a post where a savage was lurking and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,waited only till my efforts should place me within reach of his fangs.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The first impulse was to arm myself against this enemy. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desperateness of my condition was, for a moment, forgotten. The weapon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which was so lately lifted against my own bosom was now raised to defend
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my life against the assault of another.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was no time for deliberation and delay. In a moment he might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spring from his station and tear me to pieces. My utmost speed might not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enable me to reach him where he sat, but merely to encounter his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assault. I did not reflect how far my strength was adequate to save me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,All the force that remained was mustered up and exerted in a throw.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,No one knows the powers that are latent in his constitution. Called
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forth by imminent dangers, our efforts frequently exceed our most
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sanguine belief. Though tottering on the verge of dissolution, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,apparently unable to crawl from this spot, a force was exerted in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,throw, probably greater than I had ever before exerted. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resistless and unerring. I aimed at the middle space between those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,glowing orbs. It penetrated the skull, and the animal fell, struggling
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and shrieking, on the ground.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My ears quickly informed me when his pangs were at an end. His cries and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his convulsions lasted for a moment and then ceased. The effect of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,voice, in these subterranean abodes, was unspeakably rueful.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The abruptness of this incident, and the preternatural exertion of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,strength, left me in a state of languor and sinking, from which slowly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and with difficulty I recovered. The first suggestion that occurred was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to feed upon the carcass of this animal. My hunger had arrived at that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pitch where all fastidiousness and scruples are at an end. I crept to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the spot. I will not shock you by relating the extremes to which dire
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,necessity had driven me. I review this scene with loathing and horror.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Now that it is past I look back upon it as on some hideous dream. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whole appears to be some freak of insanity. No alternative was offered,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and hunger was capable of being appeased even by a banquet so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,detestable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,If this appetite has sometimes subdued the sentiments of nature, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compelled the mother to feed upon the flesh of her offspring, it will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not excite amazement that I did not turn from the yet warm blood and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reeking fibres of a brute.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,One evil was now removed, only to give place to another. The first
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sensations of fullness had scarcely been felt when my stomach was seized
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by pangs, whose acuteness exceeded all that I ever before experienced. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bitterly lamented my inordinate avidity. The excruciations of famine
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were better than the agonies which this abhorred meal had produced.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Death was now impending with no less proximity and certainty, though in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a different form. Death was a sweet relief for my present miseries, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I vehemently longed for its arrival. I stretched myself on the ground. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,threw myself into every posture that promised some alleviation of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,evil. I rolled along the pavement of the cavern, wholly inattentive to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the dangers that environed me. That I did not fall into the pit whence I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had just emerged must be ascribed to some miraculous chance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How long my miseries endured, it is not possible to tell. I cannot even
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,form a plausible conjecture. Judging by the lingering train of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sensations, I should conjecture that some days elapsed in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deplorable condition; but nature could riot have so long sustained a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conflict like this.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Gradually my pains subsided, and I fell into a deep sleep. I was visited
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by dreams of a thousand hues. They led me to flowing streams and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plenteous banquets, which, though placed within my view, some power
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forbade me to approach. From this sleep I recovered to the fruition of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solitude and darkness, but my frame was in a state less feeble than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before That which I had eaten had produced temporary distress, but on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the whole had been of use. If this food had not been provided for me I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should scarcely have avoided death. I had reason, therefore, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,congratulate myself on the danger that had lately occurred.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had acted without foresight, and yet no wisdom could have prescribed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more salutary measures. The panther was slain, not from a view to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,relief of my hunger, but from the self-preserving and involuntary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impulse. Had I foreknown the pangs to which my ravenous and bloody meal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would give birth, I should have carefully abstained; and yet these pangs
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were a useful effort of nature to subdue and convert to nourishment the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,matter I had swallowed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was now assailed by the torments of thirst. My invention and my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,courage were anew bent to obviate this pressing evil. I reflected that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,there was some recess from this cavern, even from the spot where I now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stood. Before, I was doubtful whether in this direction from this pit
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,any avenue could be found; but, since the panther had come hither, there
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was reason to suppose the existence of some such avenue.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now likewise attended to a sound, which, from its invariable tenor,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,denoted somewhat different from the whistling of a gale. It seemed like
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the murmur of a running stream. I now prepared to go forward and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,endeavour to move along in that direction in which this sound apparently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,came.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On either side, and above my head, there was nothing but vacuity. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steps were to be guided by the pavement, which, though unequal and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rugged, appeared, on the whole, to ascend. My safety required that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should employ both hands and feet in exploring my way.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I went on thus for a considerable period. The murmur, instead of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,becoming more distinct, gradually died away. My progress was arrested by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fatigue, and I began once more to despond. My exertions produced a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perspiration, which, while it augmented my thirst, happily supplied me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with imperfect means of appeasing it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This expedient would, perhaps, have been accidentally suggested; but my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ingenuity was assisted by remembering the history of certain English
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prisoners in Bengal, whom their merciless enemy imprisoned in a small
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,room, and some of whom preserved themselves alive merely by swallowing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the moisture that flowed from their bodies. This experiment I now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,performed with no less success.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This was slender arid transitory consolation. I knew that, wandering at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,random, I might never reach the outlet of this cavern, or might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disabled, by hunger and fatigue, from going farther than the outlet. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cravings which had lately been satiated would speedily return, and my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,negligence had cut me off from the resource which had recently been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,furnished. I thought not till now that a second meal might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indispensable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To return upon my footsteps to the spot where the dead animal lay was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heartless project. I might thus be placing myself at a hopeless distance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from liberty. Besides, my track could not be retraced. I had frequently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deviated from a straight direction for the sake of avoiding impediments.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,All of which I was sensible was, that I was travelling up an irregular
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acclivity. I hoped some time to reach the summit, but had no reason for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,adhering to one line of ascent in preference to another.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To remain where I was was manifestly absurd. Whether I mounted or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,descended, a change of place was most likely to benefit me. I resolved
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to vary my direction, and, instead of ascending, keep along the side of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,what I accounted a hill. I had gone some hundred feet when the murmur,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before described, once more saluted my ear.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This sound, being imagined to proceed from a running stream, could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but light up joy in the heart of one nearly perishing with thirst. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,proceeded with new courage. The sound approached no nearer, nor became
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more distinct; but, as long as it died not away, I was satisfied to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,listen and to hope.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was eagerly observant if any the least glimmering of light should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,visit this recess. At length, on the right hand, a gleam, infinitely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,faint, caught my attention. It was wavering and unequal. I directed my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steps towards it. It became more vivid and permanent. It was of that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kind, however, which proceeded from a fire, kindled with dry sticks, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not from the sun. I now heard the crackling of flames.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This sound made me pause, or, at least, to proceed with circumspection.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At length the scene opened, and I found myself at the entrance of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cave. I quickly reached a station, when I saw a fire burning. At first
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no other object was noted, but it was easy to infer that the fire was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kindled by men, and that they who kindled it could be at no great
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus was I delivered from my prison, and restored to the enjoyment of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the air and the light. Perhaps the chance was almost miraculous that led
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me to this opening. In any other direction, I might have involved myself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in an inextricable maze and rendered my destruction sure; but what now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remained to place me in absolute security? Beyond the fire I could see
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing; but, since the smoke rolled rapidly away, it was plain that on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the opposite side the cavern was open to the air.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I went forward, but my eyes were fixed upon the fire: presently, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequence of changing my station, I perceived several feet, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,skirts of blankets. I was somewhat startled at these appearances. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,legs were naked, and scored into uncouth figures. The _moccasins_
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which lay beside them, and which were adorned in a grotesque manner, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,addition to other incidents, immediately suggested the suspicion that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they were Indians. No spectacle was more adapted than this to excite
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wonder and alarm. Had some mysterious power snatched me from the earth,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and cast me, in a moment, into the heart of the wilderness? Was I still
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the vicinity of my parental habitation, or was I thousands of miles
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distant?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Were these the permanent inhabitants of this region, or were they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wanderers and robbers? While in the heart of the mountain, I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entertained a vague belief that I was still within the precincts of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Norwalk. This opinion was shaken for a moment by the objects which I now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beheld, but it insensibly returned: yet how was this opinion to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reconciled to appearances so strange and uncouth, and what measure did a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,due regard to my safety enjoin me to take?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now gained a view of four brawny and terrific figures, stretched upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the ground. They lay parallel to each other, on their left sides; in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequence of which their faces were turned from me. Between each was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an interval where lay a musket. Their right hands seemed placed upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stocks of their guns, as if to seize them on the first moment of alarm.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The aperture through which these objects were seen was at the back of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cave, and some feet from the ground. It was merely large enough to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suffer a human body to pass. It was involved in profound darkness, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,there was no danger of being suspected or discovered as long as I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maintained silence and kept out of view.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was easily imagined that these guests would make but a short sojourn
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in this spot. There was reason to suppose that it was now night, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that, after a short repose, they would start up and resume their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,journey. It was my first design to remain shrouded in this covert till
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their departure, and I prepared to endure imprisonment and thirst
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,somewhat longer.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Meanwhile my thoughts were busy in accounting for this spectacle. I need
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not tell thee that Norwalk is the termination of a sterile and narrow
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tract which begins in the Indian country. It forms a sort of rugged and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rocky vein, and continues upwards of fifty miles. It is crossed in a few
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,places by narrow and intricate paths, by which a communication is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maintained between the farms and settlements on the opposite sides of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the ridge.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,During former Indian wars, this rude surface was sometimes traversed by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the red men, and they made, by means of it, frequent and destructive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inroads into the heart of the English settlements. During the last war,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,notwithstanding the progress of population, and the multiplied perils of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,such an expedition, a band of them had once penetrated into Norwalk, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lingered long enough to pillage and murder some of the neighbouring
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inhabitants.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I have reason to remember that event. My father's house was placed on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the verge of this solitude. Eight of these assassins assailed it at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dead of night. My parents and an infant child were murdered in their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beds; the house was pillaged, and then burnt to the ground. Happily,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,myself and my two sisters were abroad upon a visit. The preceding day
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been fixed for our return to our father's house; but a storm
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occurred, which made it dangerous to cross the river, and, by obliging
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,us to defer our journey, rescued us from captivity or death.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Most men are haunted by some species of terror or antipathy, which they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,are, for the most part, able to trace to some incident which befell them
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in their early years. You will not be surprised that the fate of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,parents, and the sight of the body of one of this savage band, who, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the pursuit that was made after them, was overtaken and killed, should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,produce lasting and terrific images in my fancy. I never looked upon or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,called up the image of a savage without shuddering.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I knew that, at this time, some hostilities had been committed on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,frontier; that a long course of injuries and encroachments had lately
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exasperated the Indian tribes; that an implacable and exterminating war
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was generally expected. We imagined ourselves at an inaccessible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance from the danger; but I could not but remember that this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,persuasion was formerly as strong as at present, and that an expedition
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which had once succeeded might possibly be attempted again. Here was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,every token of enmity and bloodshed. Each prostrate figure was furnished
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with a rifled musket, and a leathern bag tied round his waist, which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was, probably, stored with powder and ball.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,From these reflections, the sense of my own danger was revived and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enforced; but I likewise ruminated on the evils which might impend over
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,others. I should, no doubt, be safe by remaining in this nook; but might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not some means be pursued to warn others of their danger? Should they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,leave this spot without notice of their approach being given to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fearless and pacific tenants of the neighbouring district, they might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,commit, in a few hours, the most horrid and irreparable devastation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The alarm could only be diffused in one way. Could I not escape,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unperceived, and without alarming the sleepers, from this cavern? The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,slumber of an Indian is broken by the slightest noise; but, if all noise
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be precluded, it is commonly profound. It was possible, I conceived, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,leave my present post, to descend into the cave, and issue forth without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the smallest signal. Their supine posture assured me that they were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,asleep. Sleep usually comes at their bidding, and if, perchance, they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should be wakeful at an unseasonable moment, they always sit upon their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,haunches, and, leaning their elbows on their knees, consume the tedious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hours in smoking. My peril would be great. Accidents which I could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,foresee, and over which I had no command, might occur to awaken some one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at the moment I was passing the fire. Should I pass in safety, I might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,issue forth into a wilderness, of which I had no knowledge, where I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might wander till I perished with famine, or where my footsteps might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,noted and pursued and overtaken by these implacable foes. These perils
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were enormous and imminent; but I likewise considered that I might be at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no great distance from the habitations of men, and that my escape might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rescue them from the most dreadful calamities. I determined to make this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dangerous experiment without delay.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I came nearer to the aperture, and had, consequently, a larger view of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this recess. To my unspeakable dismay, I now caught a glimpse of one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seated at the fire. His back was turned towards me, so that I could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinctly survey his gigantic form and fantastic ornaments.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My project was frustrated. This one was probably commissioned to watch
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and to awaken his companions when a due portion of sleep had been taken.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That he would not be unfaithful or remiss in the performance of the part
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assigned to him was easily predicted. To pass him without exciting his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,notice (and the entrance could not otherwise be reached) was impossible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Once more I shrunk back, and revolved with hopelessness and anguish the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,necessity to which I was reduced.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This interval of dreary foreboding did not last long. Some motion in him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that was seated by the fire attracted my notice. I looked, and beheld
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him rise from his place and go forth from the cavern. This unexpected
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incident led my thoughts into a new channel. Could not some advantage be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,taken of his absence? Could not this opportunity be seized for making my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,escape? He had left his gun and hatchet on the ground. It was likely,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,therefore, that he had not gone far, and would speedily return. Might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not these weapons be seized, and some provision be thus made against the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,danger of meeting him without, or of being pursued?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Before a resolution could be formed, a new sound saluted my ear. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a deep groan, succeeded by sobs that seemed struggling for utterance but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were vehemently counteracted by the sufferer. This low and bitter
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lamentation apparently proceeded from some one within the cave. It could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not be from one of this swarthy band. It must, then, proceed from a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,captive, whom they had reserved for torment or servitude, and who had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seized the opportunity afforded by the absence of him that watched to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,give vent to his despair.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I again thrust my head forward, and beheld, lying on the ground, apart
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the rest, and bound hand and foot, a young girl. Her dress was the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,coarse russet garb of the country, and bespoke her to be some farmer's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,daughter. Her features denoted the last degree of fear and anguish, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,she moved her limbs in such a manner as showed that the ligatures by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which she was confined produced, by their tightness, the utmost degree
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of pain.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My wishes were now bent not only to preserve myself and to frustrate the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,future attempts of these savages, but likewise to relieve this miserable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,victim. This could only be done by escaping from the cavern and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,returning with seasonable aid. The sobs of the girl were likely to rouse
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the sleepers. My appearance before her would prompt her to testify her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surprise by some exclamation or shriek. What could hence be predicted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but that the band would start on their feet and level their unerring
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pieces at my head?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I know not why I was insensible to these dangers. My thirst was rendered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by these delays intolerable. It took from me, in some degree, the power
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of deliberation. The murmurs which had drawn me hither continued still
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to be heard. Some torrent or cascade could not be far distant from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entrance of the cavern, and it seemed as if one draught of clear water
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was a luxury cheaply purchased by death itself. This, in addition to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,considerations more disinterested, and which I have already mentioned,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impelled me forward.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The girl's cheek rested on the hard rock, and her eyes were dim with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tears. As they were turned towards me, however, I hoped that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,movements would be noticed by her gradually and without abruptness. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expectation was fulfilled. I had not advanced many steps before she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discovered me. This moment was critical beyond all others in the course
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my existence. My life was suspended, as it were, by a spider's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thread. All rested on the effect which this discovery should make upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this feeble victim.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was watchful of the first movement of her eye which should indicate a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consciousness of my presence. I laboured, by gestures and looks, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deter her from betraying her emotion. My attention was, at the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time, fixed upon the sleepers, and an anxious glance was cast towards
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the quarter whence the watchful savage might appear.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I stooped and seized the musket and hatchet. The space beyond the fire
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was, as I expected, open to the air. I issued forth with trembling
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steps. The sensations inspired by the dangers which environed me, added
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to my recent horrors, and the influence of the moon, which had now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gained the zenith, and whose lustre dazzled my long-benighted senses,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cannot be adequately described.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,For a minute, I was unable to distinguish objects. This confusion was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,speedily corrected, and I found myself on the verge of a steep. Craggy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eminences arose on all sides. On the left hand was a space that offered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some footing, and hither I turned. A torrent was below me, and this path
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appeared to lead to it. It quickly appeared in sight, and all foreign
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cares were, for a time, suspended.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This water fell from the upper regions of the hill, upon a flat
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,projecture which was continued on either side, and on part of which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was now standing. The path was bounded on the left by an inaccessible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wall, and on the right terminated, at the distance of two or three feet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the wall, in a precipice. The water was eight or ten paces distant,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and no impediment seemed likely to rise between us. I rushed forward
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with speed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My progress was quickly checked. Close to the falling water, seated on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the edge, his back supported by the rock, and his legs hanging over the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precipice, I now beheld the savage who left the cave before me. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,noise of the cascade and the improbability of interruption, at least
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from this quarter, had made him inattentive to my motions.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I paused. Along this verge lay the only road by which I could reach the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,water, and by which I could escape. The passage was completely occupied
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by this antagonist. To advance towards him, or to remain where I was,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would produce the same effect. I should, in either case, be detected. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was unarmed; but his outcries would instantly summon his companions to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his aid. I could not hope to overpower him, and pass him in defiance of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his opposition. But, if this were effected, pursuit would be instantly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,commenced. I was unacquainted with the way. The way was unquestionably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,difficult. My strength was nearly annihilated; I should be overtaken in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a moment, or their deficiency in speed would be supplied by the accuracy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of their aim. Their bullets, at least, would reach me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was one method of removing this impediment. The piece which I held
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in my hand was cocked. There could be no doubt that it was loaded. A
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precaution of this kind would never be omitted by a warrior of this hue.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At a greater distance than this, I should not fear to reach the mark.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Should I not discharge it, and, at the same moment, rush forward to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,secure the road which my adversary's death would open to me?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Perhaps you will conceive a purpose like this to have argued a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sanguinary and murderous disposition. Let it be remembered, however,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I entertained no doubts about the hostile designs of these men.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This was sufficiently indicated by their arms, their guise, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,captive who attended them. Let the fate of my parents be, likewise,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remembered. I was not certain but that these very men were the assassins
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my family, and were those who had reduced me and my sisters to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,condition of orphans and dependants. No words can describe the torments
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my thirst. Relief to these torments, and safety to my life, were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,within view. How could I hesitate?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Yet I did hesitate. My aversion to bloodshed was not to be subdued but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by the direst necessity. I knew, indeed, that the discharge of a musket
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would only alarm the enemies who remained behind; but I had another and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a better weapon in my grasp. I could rive the head of my adversary, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cast him headlong, without any noise which should be heard, into the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cavern.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Still I was willing to withdraw, to re-enter the cave, and take shelter
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the darksome recesses from which I had emerged. Here I might remain,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unsuspected, till these detested guests should depart. The hazards
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attending my re-entrance were to be boldly encountered, and the torments
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of unsatisfied thirst were to be patiently endured, rather than imbrue
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my hands in the blood of my fellowmen. But this expedient would be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ineffectual if my retreat should be observed by this savage. Of that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was bound to be incontestably assured. I retreated, therefore, but kept
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my eye fixed at the same time upon the enemy.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some ill fate decreed that I should not retreat unobserved. Scarcely had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I withdrawn three paces when he started from his seat, and, turning
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,towards me, walked with a quick pace. The shadow of the rock, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,improbability of meeting an enemy here, concealed me for a moment from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his observation. I stood still. The slightest motion would have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attracted his notice. At present, the narrow space engaged all his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vigilance. Cautious footsteps, and attention to the path, were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indispensable to his safety. The respite was momentary, and I employed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it in my own defence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How otherwise could I act? The danger that impended aimed at nothing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,less than my life. To take the life of another was the only method of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,averting it. The means were in my hand, and they were used. In an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extremity like this, my muscles would have acted almost in defiance of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my will.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The stroke was quick as lightning, and the wound mortal and deep. He had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not time to descry the author of his fate, but, sinking on the path,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expired without a groan. The hatchet buried itself in his breast, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rolled with him to the bottom of the precipice.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Never before had I taken the life of a human creature. On this head I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had, indeed, entertained somewhat of religious scruples. These scruples
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,did not forbid me to defend myself, but they made me cautious and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reluctant to decide. Though they could not withhold my hand when urged
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by a necessity like this, they were sufficient to make me look back upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the deed with remorse and dismay.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I did not escape all compunction in the present instance, but the tumult
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my feelings was quickly allayed. To quench my thirst was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consideration by which all others were supplanted. I approached the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,torrent, and not only drank copiously, but laved my head, neck, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arms, in this delicious element.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XVIII.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Never was any delight worthy of comparison with the raptures which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,then experienced. Life, that was rapidly ebbing, appeared to return upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me with redoubled violence. My languors, my excruciating heat, vanished
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in a moment, and I felt prepared to undergo the labours of Hercules.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Having fully supplied the demands of nature in this respect, I returned
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to reflection on the circumstances of my situation. The path winding
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,round the hill was now free from all impediments. What remained but to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precipitate my flight? I might speedily place myself beyond all danger.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I might gain some hospitable shelter, where my fatigues might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repaired by repose, and my wounds be cured. I might likewise impart to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my protectors seasonable information of the enemies who meditated their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destruction.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I thought upon the condition of the hapless girl whom I had left in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,power of the savages. Was it impossible to rescue her? Might I not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,relieve her from her bonds, and make her the companion of my flight? The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exploit was perilous, but not impracticable. There was something
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dastardly and ignominious in withdrawing from the danger, and leaving a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,helpless being exposed to it. A single minute might suffice to snatch
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her from death or captivity. The parents might deserve that I should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hazard or even sacrifice my life in the cause of their child.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,After some fluctuation, I determined to return to the cavern and attempt
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the rescue of the girl. The success of this project depended on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,continuance of their sleep. It was proper to approach with wariness, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to heed the smallest token which might bespeak their condition. I crept
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,along the path, bending my ear forward to catch any sound that might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arise. I heard nothing but the half-stifled sobs of the girl.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I entered with the slowest and most anxious circumspection. Every thing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was found in its pristine state. The girl noticed my entrance with a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mixture of terror and joy. My gestures and looks enjoined upon her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,silence. I stooped down, and, taking another hatchet, cut asunder the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deer-skin thongs by which her wrists and ankles were tied. I then made
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,signs for her to rise and follow me. She willingly complied with my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,directions; but her benumbed joints and lacerated sinews refused to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,support her. There was no time to be lost; I therefore lifted her in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arms, and, feeble and tottering as I was, proceeded with this burden
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,along the perilous steep and over a most rugged-path.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I hoped that some exertion would enable her to retrieve the use of her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,limbs. I set her, therefore, on her feet, exhorting her to walk as well
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as she was able, and promising her my occasional assistance. The poor
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,girl was not deficient in zeal, and presently moved along with light and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quick steps. We speedily reached the bottom of the hill.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,No fancy can conceive a scene more wild and desolate than that which now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,presented itself. The soil was nearly covered with sharp fragments of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stone. Between these, sprung brambles and creeping vines, whose twigs,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,crossing and intertwining with each other, added to the roughness below,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made the passage infinitely toilsome. Scattered over this space were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,single cedars with their ragged spines and wreaths of moss, and copses
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of dwarf oaks, which were only new emblems of sterility.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was wholly unacquainted with the scene before me. No marks of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,habitation or culture, no traces of the footsteps of men, were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discernible. I scarcely knew in what region of the globe I was placed. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had come hither by means so inexplicable as to leave it equally in doubt
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whether I was separated from my paternal abode by a river or an ocean.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I made inquiries of my companion, but she was unable to talk coherently.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She answered my questions with weeping, and sobs, and entreaties to fly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the scene of her distress. I collected from her, at length, that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her father's house had been attacked on the preceding evening, and all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the family but herself destroyed. Since this disaster she had walked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,very fast and a great way, but knew not how far or in what direction.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In a wilderness like this, my only hope was to light upon obscure paths,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made by cattle. Meanwhile I endeavoured to adhere to one line, and to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,burst through the vexatious obstacles which encumbered our way. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ground was concealed by the bushes, and we were perplexed and fatigued
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by a continual succession of hollows and prominences. At one moment we
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were nearly thrown headlong into a pit. At another we struck our feet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,against the angles of stones. The branches of the oak rebounded in our
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,faces or entangled our legs, and the unseen thorns inflicted on us a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thousand wounds.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was obliged, in these arduous circumstances, to support not only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,myself, but my companion. Her strength was overpowered by her evening
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,journey, and the terror of being overtaken incessantly harassed her.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sometimes we lighted upon tracks which afforded us an easier footing and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inspired us with courage to proceed. These, for a time, terminated at a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brook or in a bog, and we were once more compelled to go forward at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,random. One of these tracks insensibly became more beaten, and, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length, exhibited the traces of wheels. To this I adhered, confident
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that it would finally conduct us to a dwelling.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On either side, the undergrowth of shrubs and brambles continued as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before. Sometimes small spaces were observed, which had lately been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cleared by fire. At length a vacant space, of larger dimensions than had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hitherto occurred, presented itself to my view. It was a field of some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acres, that had, apparently, been upturned by the hoe. At the corner of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this field was a small house.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My heart leaped with joy at this sight. I hastened towards it, in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hope that my uncertainties, and toils, and dangers, were now drawing to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a close. This dwelling was suited to the poverty and desolation which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surrounded it. It consisted of a few unhewn logs laid upon each other,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the height of eight or ten feet, including a quadrangular space of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,similar dimensions, and covered by a thatch. There was no window, light
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being sufficiently admitted into the crevices between the logs. These
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had formerly been loosely plastered with clay; but air and rain had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,crumbled and washed the greater part of this rude cement away. Somewhat
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,like a chimney, built of half-burnt bricks, was perceived at one corner.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The door was fastened by a leathern thong, tied to a peg.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,All within was silence and darkness. I knocked at the door and called,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but no one moved or answered. The tenant, whoever he was, was absent.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His leave could not be obtained, and I, therefore, entered without it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The autumn had made some progress, and the air was frosty and sharp. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mind and muscles had been of late so strenuously occupied, that the cold
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had not been felt. The cessation of exercise, however, quickly restored
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my sensibility in this respect, but the unhappy girl complained of being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,half frozen.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Fire, therefore, was the first object of my search. Happily, some embers
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were found upon the hearth, together with potato-stalks and dry chips.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Of these, with much difficulty, I kindled a fire, by which some warmth
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was imparted to our shivering limbs. The light enabled me, as I sat upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the ground, to survey the interior of this mansion.  Three saplings,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stripped of their branches and bound together at their ends by twigs,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,formed a kind of bedstead, which was raised from the ground by four
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stones. Ropes stretched across these, and covered by a blanket,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,constituted the bed. A board, of which one end rested on the bedstead
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the other was thrust between the logs that composed the wall,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sustained the stale fragments of a rye-loaf, and a cedar bucket kept
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entire by withes instead of hoops. In the bucket was a little water,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,full of droppings from the roof, drowned insects, and sand. A basket or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,two neatly made, and a hoe, with a stake thrust into it by way of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,handle, made up all the furniture that was visible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Next to cold, hunger was the most urgent necessity by which we were now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pressed. This was no time to give ear to scruples. We, therefore,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unceremoniously divided the bread and water between us. I had now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,leisure to bestow some regards upon the future.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These remnants of fire and food convinced me that this dwelling was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,usually inhabited, and that it had lately been deserted. Some engagement
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had probably carried the tenant abroad. His absence might be terminated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in a few minutes, or might endure through the night. On his return, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,questioned not my power to appease any indignation he might feel at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,liberties which I had taken. I was willing to suppose him one who would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,readily afford us all the information and succour that we needed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,If he should not return till sunrise, I meant to resume my journey. By
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the comfortable meal we had made, and the repose of a few hours, we
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should be considerably invigorated and refreshed, and the road would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lead us to some more hospitable tenement.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My thoughts were too tumultuous, and my situation too precarious, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,allow me to sleep. The girl, on the contrary, soon sank into a sweet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,oblivion of all her cares. She laid herself, by my advice, upon the bed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and left me to ruminate without interruption.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was not wholly free from the apprehension of danger. What influence
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this boisterous and solitary life might have upon the temper of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being who inhabited this hut, I could not predict. How soon the Indians
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might awake, and what path they would pursue, I was equally unable to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guess. It was by no means impossible that they might tread upon my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,footsteps, and knock, in a few minutes, at the door of this cottage. It
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,behooved me to make all the preparations in my power against untoward
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incidents.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had not parted with the gun which I had first seized in the cavern,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nor with the hatchet which I had afterwards used to cut the bands of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,girl. These were at once my trophies and my means of defence, which it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been rash and absurd to have relinquished. My present reliance was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,placed upon these.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now, for the first time, examined the prize that I had made. Other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,considerations had prevented me, till now, from examining the structure
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the piece; but I could not but observe that it had two barrels, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was lighter and smaller than an ordinary musket. The light of the fire
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now enabled me to inspect it with more accuracy.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Scarcely had I fixed my eyes upon the stock, when I perceived marks that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were familiar to my apprehension. Shape, ornaments, and ciphers, were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,evidently the same with those of a piece which I had frequently handled.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The marks were of a kind which could not be mistaken. This piece was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mine; and, when I left my uncle's house, it was deposited, as I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,believed, in the closet of my chamber.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thou wilt easily conceive the inference which this circumstance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggested. My hairs rose and my teeth chattered with horror. My whole
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,frame was petrified, and I paced to and fro, hurried from the chimney to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the door, and from the door to the chimney, with the misguided fury of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maniac.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I needed no proof of my calamity more incontestable than this. My uncle
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and my sisters had been murdered; the dwelling had been pillaged, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this had been a part of the plunder. Defenceless and asleep, they were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assailed by these inexorable enemies, and I, who ought to have been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their protector and champion, was removed to an immeasurable distance,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and was disabled, by some accursed chance, from affording them the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,succour which they needed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,For a time, I doubted whether I had not witnessed and shared this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,catastrophe. I had no memory of the circumstances that preceded my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,awaking in the pit. Had not the cause of my being cast into this abyss
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some connection with the ruin of my family? Had I not been dragged
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hither by these savages and reduced, by their malice, to that breathless
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and insensible condition? Was I born to a malignant destiny never tired
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of persecuting? Thus had my parents and their infant offspring perished,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and thus completed was the fate of all those to whom my affections
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cleaved, and whom the first disaster had spared.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Hitherto the death of the savage, whom I had dispatched with my hatchet,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had not been remembered without some remorse. Now my emotions were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,totally changed. I was somewhat comforted in thinking that thus much of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,necessary vengeance had been executed. New and more vehement regrets
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were excited by reflecting on the forbearance I had practised when so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,much was in my power. All the miscreants had been at my mercy, and a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bloody retribution might, with safety and ease, have been inflicted on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their prostrate bodies.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was now too late. What of consolation or of hope remained to me? To
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,return to my ancient dwelling, now polluted with blood, or, perhaps,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing but a smoking ruin, was abhorred. Life, connected with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remembrance of my misfortunes, was detestable. I was no longer anxious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for flight. No change of the scene but that which terminated all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consciousness could I endure to think of.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Amidst these gloomy meditations the idea was suddenly suggested of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,returning, with the utmost expedition, to the cavern. It was possible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that the assassins were still asleep. He who was appointed to watch, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to make, in due season, the signal for resuming their march, was forever
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,silent. Without this signal it was not unlikely that they would sleep
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,till dawn of day. But, if they should be roused, they might be overtaken
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or met, and, by choosing a proper station, two victims might at least
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fall. The ultimate event to myself would surely be fatal; but my own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,death was an object of desire rather than of dread. To die thus
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,speedily, and after some atonement was made for those who had already
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been slain, was sweet.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The way to the mountain was difficult and tedious, but the ridge was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinctly seen from the door of the cottage, and I trusted that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,auspicious chance would lead me to that part of it where my prey was to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be found. I snatched up the gun and tomahawk in a transport of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eagerness. On examining the former, I found that both barrels were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deeply loaded.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This piece was of extraordinary workmanship. It was the legacy of an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,English officer, who died in Bengal, to Sarsefield. It was constructed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for the purposes not of sport but of war. The artist had made it a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,congeries of tubes and springs, by which every purpose of protection and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,offence was effectually served. A dagger's blade was attached to it,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,capable of being fixed at the end, and of answering the destructive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,purpose of a bayonet. On his departure from Solesbury, my friend left
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it, as a pledge of his affection, in my possession. Hitherto I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chiefly employed it in shooting at a mark, in order to improve my sight;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now was I to profit by the gift in a different way.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus armed, I prepared to sally forth on my adventurous expedition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sober views might have speedily succeeded to the present tempest of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passions. I might have gradually discovered the romantic and criminal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,temerity of my project, the folly of revenge, and the duty of preserving
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my life for the benefit of mankind. I might have suspected the propriety
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my conclusion, and have admitted some doubts as to the catastrophe
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I imagined to have befallen my uncle and sisters. I might, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,least, have consented to ascertain their condition with my own eyes, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for this end have returned to the cottage, and have patiently waited
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,till the morning light should permit me to resume my journey.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This conduct was precluded by a new incident. Before I opened the door I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,looked through a crevice of the wall, and perceived three human figures
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at the farther end of the field. They approached the house. Though
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indistinctly seen, something in their port persuaded me that these were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the Indians from whom I had lately parted. I was startled but not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dismayed. My thirst of vengeance was still powerful, and I believed that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the moment of its gratification was hastening. In a short time they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would arrive and enter the house. In what manner should they be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,received?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I studied not my own security. It was the scope of my wishes to kill the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whole number of my foes; but, that being done, I was indifferent to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequences. I desired not to live to relate or to exult in the deed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To go forth was perilous and useless. All that remained was to sit upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the ground opposite the door, and fire at each as he entered. In the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hasty survey I had taken of this apartment, one object had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,overlooked, or imperfectly noticed. Close to the chimney was an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,aperture, formed by a cavity partly in the wall and in the ground. It
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was the entrance of an oven, which resembled, on the outside, a mound of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,earth, and which was filled with dry stalks of potatoes and other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rubbish.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Into this it was possible to thrust my body. A sort of screen might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,formed of the brushwood, and more deliberate and effectual execution be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,done upon the enemy. I weighed not the disadvantages of this scheme, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precipitately threw myself into this cavity. I discovered, in an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instant, that it was totally unfit for my purpose; but it was too late
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to repair my miscarriage.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This wall of the hovel was placed near the verge of a sand-bank. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,oven was erected on the very brink. This bank, being of a loose and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mutable soil, could not sustain my weight. It sunk, and I sunk along
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with it. The height of the bank was three or four feet, so that, though
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disconcerted and embarrassed, I received no injury. I still grasped my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gun, and resumed my feet in a moment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What was now to be done? The bank screened me from the view of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,savages. The thicket was hard by, and, if I were eager to escape, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,way was obvious and sure. But, though single, though enfeebled by toil,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by abstinence, and by disease, and though so much exceeded in number and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,strength by my foes, I was determined to await and provoke the contest.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In addition to the desperate impulse of passion, I was swayed by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thoughts of the danger which beset the sleeping girl, and from which my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flight would leave her without protection. How strange is the destiny
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that governs mankind! The consequence of shrouding myself in this cavity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had not been foreseen. It was an expedient which courage and not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cowardice suggested; and yet it was the only expedient by which flight
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been rendered practicable. To have issued from the door would only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have been to confront, and not to elude, the danger.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The first impulse prompted me to re-enter the cottage by this avenue,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but this could not be done with certainty and expedition. What then
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remained? While I deliberated, the men approached, and, after a moment's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hesitation, entered the house, the door being partly open.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The fire on the hearth enabled them to survey the room. One of them
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise. This was easily interpreted.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,They had noticed the girl who had lately been their captive lying asleep
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on the blanket. Their astonishment at finding her here, and in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,condition, may be easily conceived.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now reflected that I might place myself, without being observed, near
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the entrance, at an angle of the building, and shoot at each as he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,successively came forth. I perceived that the bank conformed to two
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sides of the house, and that I might gain a view of the front and of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entrance, without exposing myself to observation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I lost no time in gaining this station. The bank was as high as my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,breast. It was easy, therefore, to crouch beneath it, to bring my eye
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,close to the verge, and, laying my gun upon the top of it among the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grass, with its muzzles pointed to the door, patiently to wait their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forthcoming.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My eye and my ear were equally attentive to what was passing. A low and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,muttering conversation was maintained in the house. Presently I heard a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heavy stroke descend. I shuddered, and my blood ran cold at the sound. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entertained no doubt but that it was the stroke of a hatchet on the head
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or breast of the helpless sleeper.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was followed by a loud shriek. The continuance of these shrieks
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,proved that the stroke had not been instantly fatal. I waited to hear it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repeated, but the sounds that now arose were like those produced by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dragging somewhat along the ground. The shrieks, meanwhile, were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incessant and piteous. My heart faltered, and I saw that mighty efforts
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,must be made to preserve my joints and my nerves steadfast. All depended
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on the strenuous exertions and the fortunate dexterity of a moment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,One now approached the door, and came forth, dragging the girl, whom he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,held by the hair, after him. What hindered me from shooting at his first
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appearance, I know not. This had been my previous resolution. My hand
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,touched the trigger, and, as he moved, the piece was levelled at his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,right ear. Perhaps the momentous consequences of my failure made me wait
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,till his ceasing to move might render my aim more sure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Having dragged the girl, still piteously shrieking, to the distance of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ten feet from the house, he threw her from him with violence. She fell
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon the ground, and, observing him level his piece at her breast,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,renewed her supplications in a still more piercing tone. Little did the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forlorn wretch think that her deliverance was certain and near. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rebuked myself for having thus long delayed. I fired, and my enemy sunk
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon the ground without a struggle.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus far had success attended me in this unequal contest. The next shot
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would leave me nearly powerless. If that, however, proved as unerring as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the first, the chances of defeat were lessened. The savages within,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowing the intentions of their associate with regard to the captive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,girl, would probably mistake the report which they heard for that of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,piece. Their mistake, however, would speedily give place to doubts, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they would rush forth to ascertain the truth. It behooved me to provide
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a similar reception for him that next appeared.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was as I expected. Scarcely was my eye again fixed upon the entrance,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,when a tawny and terrific visage was stretched fearfully forth. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the signal of his fate. His glances, cast wildly and swiftly round,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lighted upon me, and on the fatal instrument which was pointed at his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forehead. His muscles were at once exerted to withdraw his head, and to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vociferate a warning to his fellow; but his movement was too slow. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ball entered above his ear. He tumbled headlong to the ground, bereaved
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of sensation though not of life, and had power only to struggle and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mutter.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Think not that I relate these things with exultation or tranquillity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,All my education and the habits of my life tended to unfit me for a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contest and a scene like this. But I was not governed by the soul which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,usually regulates my conduct. I had imbibed, from the unparalleled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,events which had lately happened, a spirit vengeful, unrelenting, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ferocious.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was now an interval for flight. Throwing my weapons away, I might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gain the thicket in a moment. I had no ammunition, nor would time be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,afforded me to reload my piece. My antagonist would render my poniard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and my speed of no use to me. Should he miss me as I fled, the girl
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would remain to expiate, by her agonies and death, the fate of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,companions.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These thoughts passed through my mind in a shorter time than is demanded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to express them. They yielded to an expedient suggested by the sight of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the gun that had been raised to destroy the girl, and which now lay upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the ground. I am not large of bone, but am not deficient in agility and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,strength. All that remained to me of these qualities was now exerted;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, dropping my own piece, I leaped upon the bank, and flew to seize my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prize.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was not till I snatched it from the ground, that the propriety of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regaining my former post rushed upon my apprehension. He that was still
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,posted in the hovel would mark me through the seams of the wall, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,render my destruction sure. I once more ran towards the bank, with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intention to throw myself below it. All this was performed in an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instant; but my vigilant foe was aware of his advantage, and fired
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,through an opening between the logs. The bullet grazed my cheek, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,produced a benumbing sensation that made me instantly fall to the earth.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Though bereaved of strength, and fraught with the belief that I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,received a mortal wound, my caution was not remitted. I loosened not my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grasp of the gun, and the posture into which I accidentally fell enabled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me to keep an eye upon the house and a hand upon the trigger. Perceiving
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my condition, the savage rushed from his covert in order to complete his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,work; but at three steps from the threshold he received my bullet in his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,breast. The uplifted tomahawk fell from his hand, and, uttering a loud
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shriek, he fell upon the body of his companion. His cries struck upon my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heart, and I wished that his better fortune had cast this evil from him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus I have told thee a bloody and disastrous tale. When thou reflectest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on the mildness of my habits, my antipathy to scenes of violence and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bloodshed, my unacquaintance with the use of fire-arms and the motives
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of a soldier, thou wilt scarcely allow credit to my story. That one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rushing into these dangers, unfurnished with stratagems or weapons,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disheartened and enfeebled by hardships and pain, should subdue four
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,antagonists trained from their infancy to the artifices and exertions of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Indian warfare, will seem the vision of fancy, rather than the lesson of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,truth.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I lifted my head from the ground and pondered upon this scene. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,magnitude of this exploit made me question its reality. By attending to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my own sensations, I discovered that I had received no wound, or, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,least, none of which there was reason to complain. The blood flowed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plentifully from my cheek, but the injury was superficial. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,otherwise with my antagonists. The last that had fallen now ceased to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,groan. Their huge limbs, inured to combat and _war-worn_, were useless
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to their own defence, and to the injury of others.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The destruction that I witnessed was vast. Three beings, full of energy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and heroism, endowed with minds strenuous and lofty, poured out their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lives before me. I was the instrument of their destruction. This scene
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of carnage and blood was laid by me. To this havoc and horror was I led
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by such rapid footsteps!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My anguish was mingled with astonishment. In spite of the force and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uniformity with which my senses were impressed by external objects, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,transition I had undergone was so wild and inexplicable; all that I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,performed, all that I had witnessed since my egress from the pit, were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,so contradictory to precedent events, that I still clung to the belief
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that my thoughts were confused by delirium. From these reveries I was at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length recalled by the groans of the girl, who lay near me on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ground.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I went to her and endeavoured to console her. I found that, while lying
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the bed, she had received a blow upon the side, which was still
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,productive of acute pain. She was unable to rise or to walk, and it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plain that one or more of her ribs had been fractured by the blow.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I knew not what means to devise for our mutual relief. It was possible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that the nearest dwelling was many leagues distant. I knew not in what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,direction to go in order to find it, and my strength would not suffice
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to carry my wounded companion thither in my arms. There was no expedient
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but to remain in this field of blood till the morning.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had scarcely formed this resolution before the report of a musket was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heard at a small distance. At the same moment, I distinctly heard the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whistling of a bullet near me. I now remembered that, of the five
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Indians whom I saw in the cavern, I was acquainted with the destiny only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of four. The fifth might be still alive, and fortune might reserve for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him the task of avenging his companions. His steps might now be tending
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hither in search of them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The musket belonging to him who was shot upon the threshold was still
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,charged. It was discreet to make all the provision in my power against
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,danger. I possessed myself of this gun, and, seating myself on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ground, looked carefully on all sides, to descry the approach of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enemy. I listened with breathless eagerness.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Presently voices were heard. They ascended from that part of the thicket
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from which my view was intercepted by the cottage. These voices had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,something in them that bespoke them to belong to friends and countrymen.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,As yet I was unable to distinguish words.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Presently my eye was attracted to one quarter, by a sound as of feet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,trampling down bushes. Several heads were seen moving in succession, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at length the whole person was conspicuous. One after another leaped
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,over a kind of mound which bordered the field, and made towards the spot
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,where I sat. This band was composed of ten or twelve persons, with each
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a gun upon his shoulder. Their guise, the moment it was perceived,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dissipated all my apprehensions.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,They came within the distance of a few paces before they discovered me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,One stopped, and, bespeaking the attention of his followers, called to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,know who was there. I answered that I was a friend, who entreated their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assistance. I shall not paint their astonishment when, on coming nearer,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they beheld me surrounded by the arms and dead bodies of my enemies.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I sat upon the ground, supporting my head with my left hand, and resting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on my knee the stock of a heavy musket. My countenance was wan and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,haggard, my neck and bosom were dyed in blood, and my limbs, almost
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stripped by the brambles of their slender covering, were lacerated by a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thousand wounds. Three savages, two of whom were steeped in gore, lay at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a small distance, with the traces of recent life on their visages. Hard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by was the girl, venting her anguish in the deepest groans, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entreating relief from the new-comers.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,One of the company, on approaching the girl, betrayed the utmost
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perturbation. "Good God!" he cried, "is this a dream? Can it be you?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Speak!"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Ah, my father! my father!" answered she, "it is I indeed."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The company, attracted by this dialogue, crowded round the girl, whom
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her father, clasping in his arms, lifted from the ground, and pressed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in a transport of joy, to his breast. This delight was succeeded by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solicitude respecting her condition. She could only answer his inquiries
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by complaining that her side was bruised to pieces. "How came you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,here?"--"Who hurt you?"--"Where did the Indians carry you?"--were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,questions to which she could make no reply but by sobs and plaints.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My own calamities were forgotten in contemplating the fondness and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compassion of the man for his child. I derived new joy from reflecting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I had not abandoned her, and that she owed her preservation to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,efforts. The inquiries which the girl was unable to answer were now put
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to me. Every one interrogated me who I was, whence I had come, and what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had given rise to this bloody contest.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was not willing to expatiate on my story. The spirit which had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hitherto sustained me began now to subside. My strength ebbed away with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my blood. Tremors, lassitude, and deadly cold, invaded me, and I fainted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on the ground.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Such is the capricious constitution of the human mind. While dangers
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were at hand, while my life was to be preserved only by zeal, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vigilance, and courage, I was not wanting to myself. Had my perils
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,continued, or even multiplied, no doubt my energies would have kept
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,equal pace with them; but the moment that I was encompassed by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,protectors, and placed in security, I grew powerless and faint. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,weakness was proportioned to the duration and intensity of my previous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,efforts, and the swoon into which I now sunk was, no doubt, mistaken by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the spectators for death.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On recovering from this swoon, my sensations were not unlike those which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had experienced on awaking in the pit. For a moment a mistiness
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,involved every object, and I was able to distinguish nothing. My sight,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by rapid degrees, was restored, my painful dizziness was banished, and I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surveyed the scene before me with anxiety and wonder.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I found myself stretched upon the ground. I perceived the cottage and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the neighbouring thicket, illuminated by a declining moon. My head
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rested upon something, which, on turning to examine, I found to be one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the slain Indians. The other two remained upon the earth, at a small
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance, and in the attitudes in which they had fallen. Their arms, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wounded girl, and the troop who were near me when I fainted, were gone.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My head had reposed upon the breast of him whom I had shot in this part
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his body. The blood had ceased to ooze from the wound, but my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dishevelled locks were matted and steeped in that gore which had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,overflowed and choked up the orifice. I started from this detestable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pillow, and regained my feet.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I did not suddenly recall what had lately passed, or comprehend the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nature of my situation. At length, however, late events were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recollected.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That I should be abandoned in this forlorn state by these men seemed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,argue a degree of cowardice or cruelty of which I should have thought
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them incapable. Presently, however, I reflected that appearances might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have easily misled them into a belief of my death. On this supposition,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to have carried me away, or to have stayed beside me, would be useless.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Other enemies might be abroad; or their families, now that their fears
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were somewhat tranquillized, might require their presence and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,protection.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I went into the cottage. The fire still burned, and afforded me a genial
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,warmth. I sat before it, and began to ruminate on the state to which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was reduced, and on the measures I should next pursue. Daylight could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not be very distant. Should I remain in this hovel till the morning, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,immediately resume my journey? I was feeble, indeed; but, by remaining
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,here, should I not increase my feebleness? The sooner I should gain some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,human habitation the better; whereas watchfulness and hunger would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,render me, at each minute, less able to proceed than on the former.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This spot might be visited on the next day; but this was involved in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uncertainty. The visitants, should any come, would come merely to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,examine and bury the dead, and bring with them neither the clothing nor
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the food which my necessities demanded. The road was sufficiently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discernible, and would, unavoidably, conduct me to some dwelling. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,determined, therefore, to set out without delay. Even in this state I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was not unmindful that my safety might require the precaution of being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,armed. Besides, the fusil which had been given me by Sarsefield, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I had so unexpectedly recovered, had lost none of its value in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eyes. I hoped that it had escaped the search of the troop who had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,here, and still lay below the bank in the spot where I had dropped it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In this hope I was not deceived. It was found. I possessed myself of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,powder and shot belonging to one of the savages, and loaded it. Thus
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,equipped for defence, I regained the road, and proceeded, with alacrity,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on my way. For the wound in my cheek, nature had provided a styptic, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the soreness was extreme, and I thought of no remedy but water, with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I might wash away the blood. My thirst likewise incommoded me, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I looked with eagerness for the traces of a spring. In a soil like that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the wilderness around me, nothing was less to be expected than to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,light upon water. In this respect, however, my destiny was propitious. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quickly perceived water in the ruts. It trickled hither from the thicket
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on one side, and, pursuing it among the bushes, I reached the bubbling
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,source. Though scanty and brackish, it afforded me unspeakable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,refreshment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thou wilt think, perhaps, that my perils were now at an end; that the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,blood I had already shed was sufficient for my safety. I fervently hoped
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that no new exigence would occur compelling me to use the arms that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bore in my own defence. I formed a sort of resolution to shun the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contest with a new enemy, almost at the expense of my own life. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,satiated and gorged with slaughter, and thought upon a new act of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destruction with abhorrence and loathing.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But, though I dreaded to encounter a new enemy, I was sensible that an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enemy might possibly be at hand. I had moved forward with caution, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my sight and hearing were attentive to the slightest tokens. Other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,troops, besides that which I encountered, might be hovering near, and of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that troop I remembered that one at least had survived.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The gratification which the spring had afforded me was so great, that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was in no haste to depart. I lay upon a rock, which chanced to be shaded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by a tree behind me. From this post I could overlook the road to some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance, and, at the same time, be shaded from the observation of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,others.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My eye was now caught by movements which appeared like those of a beast.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In different circumstances, I should have instantly supposed it to be a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wolf, or panther, or bear. Now my suspicions were alive on a different
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,account, and my startled fancy figured to itself nothing but a human
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,adversary.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A thicket was on either side of the road. That opposite to my station
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was discontinued at a small distance by the cultivated field. The road
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,continued along this field, bounded by the thicket on the one side and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the open space on the other. To this space the being who was now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,described was cautiously approaching.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He moved upon all fours, and presently came near enough to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinguished. His disfigured limbs, pendants from his ears and nose,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and his shorn locks, were indubitable indications of a savage,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Occasionally he reared himself above the bushes, and scanned, with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspicious vigilance, the cottage and the space surrounding it. Then he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stooped, and crept along as before.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was at no loss to interpret these appearances. This was my surviving
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enemy. He was unacquainted with the fate of his associates, and was now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,approaching the theatre of carnage to ascertain their fate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Once more was the advantage afforded me. From this spot might unerring
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,aim be taken, and the last of this hostile troop be made to share the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fate of the rest. Should I fire, or suffer him to pass in safety?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My abhorrence of bloodshed was not abated. But I had not foreseen this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occurrence. My success hitherto had seemed to depend upon a combination
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of fortunate incidents, which could not be expected again to take place;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but now was I invested with the same power. The mark was near; nothing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obstructed or delayed; I incurred no danger, and the event was certain.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Why should he be suffered to live? He came hither to murder and despoil
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my friends; this work he has, no doubt, performed. Nay, has he not borne
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his part in the destruction of my uncle and my sisters? He will live
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,only to pursue the same sanguinary trade; to drink the blood and exult
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the laments of his unhappy foes and of my own brethren. Fate has
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reserved him for a bloody and violent death. For how long a time soever
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it may be deferred, it is thus that his career will inevitably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,terminate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Should he be spared, he will still roam in the wilderness, and I may
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,again be fated to encounter him. Then our mutual situation may be widely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,different, and the advantage I now possess may be his.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,While hastily revolving these thoughts, I was thoroughly aware that one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,event might take place which would render all deliberation useless.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Should he spy me where I lay, my fluctuations must end. My safety would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indispensably require me to shoot. This persuasion made me keep a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steadfast eye upon his motions, and be prepared to anticipate his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assault.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It now most seasonably occurred to me that one essential duty remained
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to be performed. One operation, without which fire-arms are useless, had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been unaccountably omitted. My piece was uncocked. I did not reflect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that in moving the spring a sound would necessarily be produced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficient to alarm him. But I knew that the chances of escaping his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,notice, should I be perfectly mute and still, were extremely slender,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and that, in such a case, his movements would be quicker than the light:
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it behooved me, therefore, to repair my omission.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sound struck him with alarm. He turned and darted at me an inquiring
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,glance. I saw that forbearance was no longer in my power; but my heart
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sunk while I complied with what may surely be deemed an indispensable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,necessity. This faltering, perhaps, it was that made me swerve somewhat
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the fatal line. He was disabled by the wound, but not killed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He lost all power of resistance, and was, therefore, no longer to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dreaded. He rolled upon the ground, uttering doleful shrieks, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,throwing his limbs into those contortions which bespeak the keenest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,agonies to which ill-fated man is subject. Horror, and compassion, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remorse, were mingled into one sentiment, and took possession of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heart. To shut out this spectacle, I withdrew from the spot, but I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stopped before I had moved beyond hearing of his cries.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The impulse that drove me from the scene was pusillanimous and cowardly.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The past, however deplorable, could not be recalled; but could not I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,afford some relief to this wretch? Could not I at least bring his pangs
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to a speedy close? Thus he might continue, writhing and calling upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,death, for hours. Why should his miseries be uselessly prolonged?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was but one way to end them. To kill him outright was the dictate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of compassion and of duty. I hastily returned, and once more levelled my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,piece at his head. It was a loathsome obligation, and was performed with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unconquerable reluctance. Thus to assault and to mangle the body of an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enemy, already prostrate and powerless, was an act worthy of abhorrence;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,yet it was, in this case, prescribed by pity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My faltering hand rendered this second bullet ineffectual. One
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expedient, still more detestable, remained. Having gone thus far, it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would have been inhuman to stop short. His heart might easily be pierced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by the bayonet, and his struggles would cease.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This task of cruel lenity was at length finished. I dropped the weapon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and threw myself on the ground, overpowered by the horrors of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scene. Such are the deeds which perverse nature compels thousands of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rational beings to perform and to witness! Such is the spectacle,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,endlessly prolonged and diversified, which is exhibited in every field
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of battle; of which habit and example, the temptations of gain, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,illusions of honour, will make us, not reluctant or indifferent, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,zealous and delighted actors and beholders!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus, by a series of events impossible to be computed or foreseen, was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the destruction of a band, selected from their fellows for an arduous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enterprise, distinguished by prowess and skill, and equally armed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,against surprise and force, completed by the hand of a boy, uninured to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hostility, unprovided with arms, precipitate and timorous! I have noted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,men who seemed born for no end but by their achievements to belie
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,experience, and baffle foresight, and outstrip belief. Would to God that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had not deserved to be numbered among these! But what power was it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that called me from the sleep of death just in time to escape the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,merciless knife of this enemy? Had my swoon continued till he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reached the spot, he would have effectuated my death by new wounds and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,torn away the skin from my brows. Such are the subtle threads on which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hang the fate of man and of the universe!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,While engaged in these reflections, I perceived that the moonlight had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,begun to fade before that of the sun. A dusky and reddish hue spread
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,itself over the east. Cheered by this appearance, I once more resumed my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,feet and the road. I left the savage where he lay, but made prize of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his tomahawk. I had left my own in the cavern; and this weapon added
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,little to my burden. Prompted by some freak of fancy, I stuck his musket
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the ground, and left it standing upright in the middle of the road.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XX.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I moved forward with as quick a pace as my feeble limbs would permit. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,did not allow myself to meditate. The great object of my wishes was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dwelling where food and repose might be procured. I looked earnestly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forward, and on each side, in search of some token of human residence;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but the spots of cultivation, the _well-pole_, the _worm fence_,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the hayrick, were nowhere to be seen. I did not even meet with a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wild hog or a bewildered cow. The path was narrow, and on either side
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was a trackless wilderness. On the right and left were the waving
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lines of mountainous ridges, which had no peculiarity enabling me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascertain whether I had ever before seen them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At length I noticed that the tracks of wheels had disappeared from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,path that I was treading; that it became more narrow, and exhibited
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fewer marks of being frequented. These appearances were discouraging. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now suspected that I had taken a wrong direction, and, instead of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,approaching, was receding from, the habitation of men.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was wisest, however, to proceed. The road could not but have some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,origin as well as end. Some hours passed away in this uncertainty. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sun rose, and by noonday I seemed to be farther than ever from the end
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my toils. The path was more obscure, and the wilderness more rugged.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thirst more incommoded me than hunger, but relief was seasonably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,afforded by the brooks that flowed across the path.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Coming to one of these, and having slaked my thirst, I sat down upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bank, to reflect on my situation. The circuity of the path had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,frequently been noticed, and I began to suspect that, though I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,travelled long, I had not moved far from the spot where I had commenced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my pilgrimage.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Turning my eyes on all sides, I noticed a sort of pool, formed by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rivulet, at a few paces distant from the road. In approaching and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inspecting it, I observed the footsteps of cattle, who had retired by a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,path that seemed much beaten: I likewise noticed a cedar bucket, broken
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and old, lying on the margin. These tokens revived my drooping spirits,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arid I betook myself to this new track. It was intricate, but, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length, led up a steep, the summit of which was of better soil than that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of which the flats consisted. A clover-field, and several
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,apple-trees,--sure attendants of man,--were now discovered. From this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,space I entered a corn-field, and at length, to my inexpressible joy,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,caught a glimpse of a house.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This dwelling was far different from that I had lately left. It was as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,small and as low, but its walls consisted of boards. A window of four
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,panes admitted the light, and a chimney of brick, well burnt and neatly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arranged, peeped over the roof. As I approached, I heard the voice of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,children and the hum of a spinning-wheel.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I cannot make thee conceive the delight which was afforded me by all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these tokens. I now found myself, indeed, among beings like myself, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from whom hospitable entertainment might be confidently expected. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compassed the house, and made my appearance at the door.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A good woman, busy at her wheel, with two children playing on the ground
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before her, were the objects that now presented themselves. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uncouthness of my garb, my wild and weatherworn appearance, my fusil and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tomahawk, could not but startle them. The woman stopped her wheel, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gazed as if a spectre had started into view.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was somewhat aware of these consequences, and endeavoured to elude
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them by assuming an air of supplication and humility. I told her that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was a traveller, who had unfortunately lost his way and had rambled in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this wild till nearly famished for want. I entreated her to give me some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,food; any thing, however scanty or coarse, would be acceptable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,After some pause she desired me, though not without some marks of fear,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to walk in. She placed before me some brown bread and milk. She eyed me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,while I eagerly devoured this morsel. It was, indeed, more delicious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,than any I had ever tasted. At length she broke silence, and expressed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her astonishment and commiseration at my seemingly-forlorn state, adding
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that perhaps I was the man whom the men were looking after who had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,there some hours before.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My curiosity was roused by this intimation. In answer to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interrogations, she said that three persons had lately stopped, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inquire if her husband had not met, within the last three days, a person
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of whom their description seemed pretty much to suit my person and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dress. He was tall, slender, wore nothing but shirt and trousers, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was wounded on the cheek.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What," I asked, "did they state the rank or condition of the person to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He lived in Solesbury. He was supposed to have rambled in the mountains,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and to have lost his way, or to have met with some mischance. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,three days since he had disappeared, but had been seen by some one, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,last night, at Deb's hut.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What and where was Deb's hut?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was a hut in the wilderness, occupied by an old Indian woman, known
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,among her neighbours by the name of Old Deb. Some people called her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Queen Mab. Her dwelling was eight _long_ miles from this house.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A thousand questions were precluded and a thousand doubts solved by this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,information. _Queen Mab_ were sounds familiar to my ears; for they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,originated with myself.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This woman originally belonged to the tribe of Delawares, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Lenni-lennapee. All these districts were once comprised within the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dominions of that nation. About thirty years ago, in consequence of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perpetual encroachments of the English colonists, they abandoned their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ancient seats and retired to the banks of the Wabash and Muskingum.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This emigration was concerted in a general council of the tribe, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obtained the concurrence of all but one female. Her birth, talents, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,age, gave her much consideration and authority among her countrymen; and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,all her zeal and eloquence were exerted to induce them to lay aside
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their scheme. In this, however, she could not succeed. Finding them
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,refractory, she declared her resolution to remain behind and maintain
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possession of the land which her countrymen should impiously abandon.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The village inhabited by this clan was built upon ground which now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,constitutes my uncle's barnyard and orchard. On the departure of her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,countrymen, this female burnt the empty wigwams and retired into the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fastnesses of Norwalk. She selected a spot suitable for an Indian
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dwelling and a small plantation of maize, and in which she was seldom
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,liable to interruption and intrusion.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Her only companions were three dogs, of the Indian or wolf species.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These animals differed in nothing from their kinsmen of the forest but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in their attachment and obedience to their mistress. She governed them
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with absolute sway. They were her servants and protectors, and attended
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her person or guarded her threshold, agreeably to her directions. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fed them with corn, and they supplied her and themselves with meat, by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hunting squirrels, raccoons, and rabbits.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To the rest of mankind they were aliens or enemies. They never left the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desert but in company with their mistress, and, when she entered a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,farm-house, waited her return at a distance. They would suffer none to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,approach them, but attacked no one who did not imprudently crave their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acquaintance, or who kept at a respectful distance from their wigwam.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That sacred asylum they would not suffer to be violated, and no stranger
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could enter it but at the imminent hazard of his life, unless
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accompanied and protected by their dame.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The chief employment of this woman, when at home, besides plucking the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,weeds from among her corn, bruising the grain between two stones, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,setting her snares for rabbits and opossums, was to talk. Though in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solitude, her tongue was never at rest but when she was asleep; but her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conversation was merely addressed to her dogs. Her voice was sharp and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shrill, and her gesticulations were vehement and grotesque. A hearer
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would naturally imagine that she was scolding; but, in truth, she was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,merely giving them directions. Having no other object of contemplation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or subject of discourse, she always found, in their postures and looks,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasion for praise, or blame, or command. The readiness with which they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,understood, and the docility with which they obeyed, her movements and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,words, were truly wonderful.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,If a stranger chanced to wander near her hut and overhear her jargon,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incessant as it was, and shrill, he might speculate in vain on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reason of these sounds. If he waited in expectation of hearing some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reply, he waited in vain. The strain, always voluble and sharp, was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,never intermitted for a moment, and would continue for hours at a time.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She seldom left the hut but to visit the neighbouring inhabitants and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,demand from them food and clothing, or whatever her necessities
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,required. These were exacted as her due; to have her wants supplied was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her prerogative, and to withhold what she claimed was rebellion. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conceived that by remaining behind her countrymen she succeeded to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,government and retained the possession of all this region. The English
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were aliens and sojourners, who occupied the land merely by her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,connivance and permission, and whom she allowed to remain on no terms
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but those of supplying her wants.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Being a woman aged and harmless, her demands being limited to that of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which she really stood in need, and which her own industry could not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,procure, her pretensions were a subject of mirth and good-humour, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her injunctions obeyed with seeming deference and gravity. To me she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,early became an object of curiosity and speculation. I delighted to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,observe her habits and humour her prejudices. She frequently came to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uncle's house, and I sometimes visited her: insensibly she seemed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contract an affection for me, and regarded me with more complacency and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,condescension than any other received.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She always disdained to speak English, and custom had rendered her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intelligible to most in her native language, with regard to a few simple
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,questions. I had taken some pains to study her jargon, and could make
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,out to discourse with her on the few ideas which she possessed. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumstance, likewise, wonderfully prepossessed her in my favour.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The name by which she was formerly known was Deb; but her pretensions to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,royalty, the wildness of her aspect and garb, her shrivelled and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,diminutive form, a constitution that seemed to defy the ravages of time
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the influence of the elements, her age, (which some did not scruple
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to affirm exceeded a hundred years,) her romantic solitude and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mountainous haunts, suggested to my fancy the appellation of _Queen
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Mab_. There appeared to me some rude analogy between this personage
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and her whom the poets of old time have delighted to celebrate: thou
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perhaps wilt discover nothing but incongruities between them; but, be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that as it may, Old Deb and Queen Mab soon came into indiscriminate and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,general use.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She dwelt in Norwalk upwards of twenty years. She was not forgotten by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her countrymen, and generally received from her brothers and sons an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,autumnal visit; but no solicitations or entreaties could prevail on her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to return with them. Two years ago, some suspicion or disgust induced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her to forsake her ancient habitation and to seek a hew one. Happily she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,found a more convenient habitation twenty miles to the westward, and in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a spot abundantly sterile and rude.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This dwelling was of logs, and had been erected by a Scottish emigrant,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who, not being rich enough to purchase land, and entertaining a passion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for solitude and independence, cleared a field in the unappropriated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wilderness and subsisted on its produce. After some time he disappeared.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Various conjectures were formed as to the cause of his absence. None of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them were satisfactory; but that, which obtained most credit was, that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he had been murdered by the Indians, who, about the same period, paid
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their annual visit to the _Queen_. This conjecture acquired some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,force by observing that the old woman shortly after took possession of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his hut, his implements of tillage, and his corn-field.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,She was not molested in her new abode, and her life passed in the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quiet tenor as before. Her periodical rambles, her regal claims, her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guardian wolves, and her uncouth volubility, were equally remarkable;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but her circuits were new. Her distance made her visits to Solebury more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rare, and had prevented me from ever extending my pedestrian excursions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to her present abode.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These recollections were now suddenly called up by the information of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hostess. The hut where I had sought shelter and relief was, it seems,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the residence of Queen Mab. Some fortunate occurrence had called her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,away during my visit. Had she and her dogs been at home, I should have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been set upon by these ferocious sentinels, and, before their dame could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have interfered, have been, together with my helpless companion, mangled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or killed. These animals never barked: I should have entered unaware of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my danger, and my fate could scarcely have been averted by my fusil.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Her absence at this unseasonable hour was mysterious. It was now the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time of year when her countrymen were accustomed to renew their visit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Was there a league between her and the plunderers whom I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,encountered?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But who were they by whom my footsteps were so industriously traced?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Those whom I had seen at Deb's hut were strangers to me, but the wound
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon my face was known only to them. To this circumstance was now added
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my place of residence and name. I supposed them impressed with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,belief that I was dead; but this mistake must have speedily been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rectified. Revisiting the spot, finding me gone, and obtaining some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intelligence of my former condition, they had instituted a search after
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But what tidings were these? I was supposed to have been bewildered in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the mountains, and three days were said to have passed since my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappearance. Twelve hours had scarcely elapsed since I emerged from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cavern. Had two days and a half been consumed in my subterranean
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prison?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These reflections were quickly supplanted by others. I now gained a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficient acquaintance with the region that was spread around me. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the midst of a vale included between ridges that gradually approached
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,each other, and, when joined, were broken up into hollows and steeps,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, spreading themselves over a circular space, assumed the appellation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of Norwalk. This vale gradually widened as it tended to the westward,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and was, in this place, ten or twelve miles in breadth. My devious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,footsteps had brought me to the foot of the southern barrier. The outer
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,basis of this was laved by the river; but, as it tended eastward, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mountain and river receded from each other, and one of the cultivable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,districts lying between them was Solesbury, my natal _township_.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Hither it was now my duty to return with the utmost expedition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There were two ways before me. One lay along the interior base of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hill, over a sterile and trackless space, and exposed to the encounter
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of savages, some of whom might possibly be lurking here. The other was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the well-frequented road on the outside and along the river, and which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was to be gained by passing over this hill. The practicability of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passage was to be ascertained by inquiries made to my hostess. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pointed out a path that led to the rocky summit and down to the river's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brink. The path was not easy to be kept in view or to be trodden, but it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was undoubtedly to be preferred to any other.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A route somewhat circuitous would terminate in the river-road.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thenceforward the way to Solesbury was level and direct; but the whole
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,space which I had to traverse was not less than thirty miles. In six
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hours it would be night, and to perform the journey in that time would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,demand the agile boundings of a leopard and the indefatigable sinews of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an elk.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My frame was in a miserable plight. My strength had been assailed by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,anguish, and fear, and watchfulness, by toil, and abstinence, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wounds. Still, however, some remnant was left; would it not enable me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reach my home by nightfall? I had delighted, from my childhood, in feats
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of agility and perseverance. In roving through the maze of thickets and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precipices, I had put my energies, both moral and physical, frequently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the test. Greater achievements than this had been performed, and I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disdained to be outdone in perspicacity by the lynx, in his sure-footed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instinct by the roe, or in patience under hardship, and contention with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fatigue, by the Mohawk. I have ever aspired to transcend the rest of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,animals in all that is common to the rational and brute, as well as in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,all by which they are distinguished from each other.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XXI.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I likewise burned with impatience to know the condition of my family, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dissipate at once their tormenting doubts and my own with regard to our
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mutual safety. The evil that I feared had befallen them was too enormous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to allow me to repose in suspense, and my restlessness and ominous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forebodings would be more intolerable than any hardship or toils to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I could possibly be subjected during this journey.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was much refreshed and invigorated by the food that I had taken, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by the rest of an hour. With this stock of recruited force I determined
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to scale the hill. After receiving minute directions, and, returning
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,many thanks for my hospitable entertainment, I set out.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The path was indeed intricate, and deliberate attention was obliged to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be exerted in order to preserve it. Hence my progress was slower than I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wished. The first impulse was to fix my eye upon the summit, and to leap
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from crag to crag till I reached it; but this my experience had taught
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me was impracticable. It was only by winding through gullies, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,coasting precipices and bestriding chasms, that I could hope finally to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gain the top; and I was assured that by one way only was it possible to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accomplish even this.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,An hour was spent in struggling with impediments, and I seemed to have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gained no way. Hence a doubt was suggested whether I had not missed the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,true road. In this doubt I was confirmed by the difficulties which now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grew up before me. The brooks, the angles, and the hollows, which my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hostess had described, were not to be seen. Instead of these, deeper
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dells, more headlong torrents, and wider-gaping rifts, were incessantly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,encountered.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To return was as hopeless as to proceed. I consoled myself with thinking
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that the survey which my informant had made of the hill-side might prove
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inaccurate, and that, in spite of her predictions, the heights might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reached by other means than by those pointed out by her. I will not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enumerate my toilsome expedients, my frequent disappointments, and my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desperate exertions. Suffice it to say that I gained the upper space not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,till the sun had dipped beneath the horizon.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My satisfaction at accomplishing thus much was not small, and I hied,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with renovated spirits, to the opposite brow. This proved to be a steep
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that could not be descended. The river flowed at its foot. The opposite
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bank was five hundred yards distant, and was equally towering and steep
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as that on which I stood. Appearances were adapted to persuade you that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these rocks had formerly joined, but by some mighty effort of nature had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been severed, that the stream might find way through the chasm. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,channel, however, was encumbered with asperities, over which the river
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fretted and foamed with thundering impetuosity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I pondered for a while on these stupendous scenes. They ravished my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attention from considerations that related to myself; but this interval
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was snort, and I began to measure the descent, in order to ascertain the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,practicability of treading it. My survey terminated in bitter
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappointment. I turned my eye successively eastward and westward.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Solesbury lay in the former direction, and thither I desired to go. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kept along the verge in this direction till I reached an impassable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rift. Beyond this I saw that the steep grew lower; but it was impossible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to proceed farther. Higher up the descent might be practicable, and,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,though more distant from Solesbury, it was better to reach the road even
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at that distance than never to reach it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Changing my course, therefore, I explored the spaces above. The night
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was rapidly advancing; the gray clouds gathered in the southeast, and a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chilling blast, the usual attendant of a night in October, began to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whistle among the pigmy cedars that scantily grew upon these heights. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,progress would quickly be arrested by darkness, and it behooved me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,provide some place of shelter and repose. No recess better than a hollow
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the rock presented itself to my anxious scrutiny.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Meanwhile, I would not dismiss the hope of reaching the road, which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,saw some hundred feet below, winding along the edge of the river, before
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,daylight should utterly fail. Speedily these hopes derived new vigour
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from meeting a ledge that irregularly declined from the brow of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hill. It was wide enough to allow of cautious footing. On a similar
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stratum, or ledge, projecting still farther from the body of the hill,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and close to the surface of the river, was the road. This stratum
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascended from the level of the stream, while that on which I trod
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rapidly descended. I hoped that they would speedily be blended, or, at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,least, approach so near as to allow me to leap from one to the other
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,without enormous hazard.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This fond expectation was frustrated. Presently I perceived that the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ledge below began to descend, while that above began to tend upward and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was quickly terminated by the uppermost surface of the cliff. Here it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was needful to pause. I looked over the brink, and considered whether I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might not leap from my present station without endangering my limbs. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,road into which I should fall was a rocky pavement far from being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,smooth. The descent could not be less than forty or fifty feet. Such an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attempt was, to the last degree, hazardous; but was it not better to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,risk my life by leaping from this eminence than to remain and perish on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the top of this inhospitable mountain? The toils which I had endured in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reaching this height appeared, to my panic-struck fancy, less easy to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,borne again than death.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I know not but that I should have finally resolved to leap, had not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,different views been suggested by observing that the outer edge of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,road was, in like manner, the brow of a steep which terminated in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,river. The surface of the road was twelve or fifteen feet above the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,level of the stream, which, in this spot, was still and smooth. Hence I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inferred that the water was not of inconsiderable depth. To fall upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rocky points was, indeed, dangerous, but to plunge into water of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficient depth, even from a height greater than that at which I now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stood, especially to one to whom habit had rendered water almost as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,congenial an element as air, was scarcely attended with inconvenience.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This expedient was easy and safe. Twenty yards from this spot, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,channel was shallow, and to gain the road from the stream was no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,difficult exploit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some disadvantages, however, attended this scheme. The water was smooth;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but this might arise from some other cause than its depth. My gun,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,likewise, must be left behind me; and that was a loss to which I felt
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,invincible repugnance. To let it fall upon the road would put it in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,power to retrieve the possession, but it was likely to be irreparably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,injured by the fall.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,While musing upon this expedient, and weighing injuries with benefits,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the night closed upon me. I now considered that, should I emerge in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,safety from the stream, I should have many miles to travel before I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could reach a house. My clothes meanwhile would be loaded with wet. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should be heart-pierced by the icy blast that now blew, and my wounds
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and bruises would be chafed into insupportable pain.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I reasoned likewise on the folly of impatience and the necessity of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repose. By thus long continuance in one posture, my sinews began to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stiffen, and my reluctance to make new exertions to increase. My brows
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were heavy, and I felt an irresistible propensity to sleep. I concluded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to seek some shelter, and resign myself, my painful recollections, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my mournful presages, to sweet forgetfulness. For this end, I once more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascended to the surface of the cliff. I dragged my weary feet forward,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,till I found somewhat that promised me the shelter that I sought.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A cluster of cedars appeared, whose branches overarched a space that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might be called a bower. It was a slight cavity, whose flooring was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,composed of loose stones and a few faded leaves blown from a distance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and finding a temporary lodgment here. On one side was a rock, forming a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wall rugged and projecting above. At the bottom of the rock was a rift,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,somewhat resembling a coffin in shape, and not much larger in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dimensions. This rift terminated, on the opposite side of the rock, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an opening that was too small for the body of a man to pass. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance between each entrance was twice the length of a man.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This bower was open to the southeast, whence the gale now blew. It
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,therefore imperfectly afforded the shelter of which I stood in need;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but it was the best that the place and the time afforded. To stop the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,smaller entrance of the cavity with a stone, and to heap before the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,other branches lopped from the trees with my hatchet, might somewhat
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contribute to my comfort.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This was done, and, thrusting myself into this recess as far as I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,able, I prepared for repose. It might have been reasonably suspected to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be the den of rattlesnakes or panthers; but my late contention with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,superior dangers and more formidable enemies made me reckless of these.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But another inconvenience remained. In spite of my precautions, my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,motionless posture and slender covering exposed me so much to the cold
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I could not sleep.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The air appeared to have suddenly assumed the temperature of midwinter.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In a short time, my extremities were benumbed, and my limbs shivered and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ached as if I had been seized by an ague. My bed likewise was dank and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uneven, and the posture I was obliged to assume, unnatural and painful.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was evident that my purpose could not be answered by remaining here.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I therefore crept forth, and began to reflect upon the possibility of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,continuing my journey. Motion was the only thing that could keep me from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,freezing, and my frame was in that state which allowed me to take no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repose in the absence of warmth, since warmth was indispensable. It now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occurred to me to ask whether it were not possible to kindle a fire.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sticks and leaves were at hand. My hatchet and a pebble would enable me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to extract a spark. From this, by suitable care and perseverance, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might finally procure sufficient fire to give me comfort and ease, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,even enable me to sleep. This boon was delicious, and I felt as if I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were unable to support a longer deprivation of it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I proceeded to execute this scheme. I took the driest leaves, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,endeavoured to use them as tinder; but the driest leaves were moistened
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by the dews. They were only to be found in the hollows, in some of which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were pools of water and others were dank. I was not speedily
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discouraged; but my repeated attempts failed, and I was finally
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compelled to relinquish this expedient.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,All that now remained was to wander forth and keep myself in motion till
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the morning. The night was likely to prove tempestuous and long. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gale seemed freighted with ice, and acted upon my body like the points
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of a thousand needles. There was no remedy, and I mustered my patience
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to endure it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I returned again to the brow of the hill. I ranged along it till I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reached a place where the descent was perpendicular, and, in consequence
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of affording no sustenance to trees or bushes, was nearly smooth and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bare. There was no road to be seen; and this circumstance, added to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sounds which the rippling current produced, afforded me some knowledge
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my situation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The ledge along which the road was conducted disappeared near this spot.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The opposite sides of the chasm through which flowed the river
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,approached nearer to each other, in the form of jutting promontories. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now stood upon the verge of that on the northern side. The water
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flowed at the foot, but, for the space of ten or twelve feet from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rock, was so shallow as to permit the traveller and his horse to wade
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,through it, and thus to regain the road which the receding precipice had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,allowed to be continued on the farther side.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I knew the nature and dimensions of this ford. I knew that, at a few
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,yards from the rock, the channel was of great depth. To leap into it, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this place, was a less dangerous exploit than at the spot where I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,formerly been tempted to leap. There I was unacquainted with the depth,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but here I knew it to be considerable. Still, there was some ground of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hesitation and fear. My present station was loftier, and how deeply I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might sink into this gulf, how far the fall and the concussion would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bereave me of my presence of mind, I could not determine. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hesitation vanished, and, placing my tomahawk and fusil upon the ground,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I prepared to leap.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This purpose was suspended, in the moment of its execution, by a faint
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sound, heard from the quarter whence I had come. It was the warning of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,men, but had nothing in common with those which I had been accustomed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hear. It was not the howling of a wolf or the yelling of a panther.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These had often been overheard by night during my last year's excursion
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the lakes. My fears whispered that this was the vociferation of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,savage.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was unacquainted with the number of the enemies who had adventured
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into this district. Whether those whom I had encountered at _Deb's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hut_ were of that band whom I had met with in the cavern, was merely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a topic of conjecture. There might be a half-score of troops, equally
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,numerous, spread over the wilderness, and the signal I had just heard
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,might betoken the approach of one of these. Yet by what means they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should gain this nook, and what prey they expected to discover, were not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,easily conceived.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sounds, somewhat diversified, nearer and rising from different
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quarters, were again heard. My doubts and apprehensions were increased.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What expedient to adopt for my own safety was a subject of rapid
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,meditation:--whether to remain stretched upon the ground or to rise and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,go forward. Was it likely the enemy would coast along the edge of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steep? Would they ramble hither to look upon the ample scene which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spread on all sides around the base of this rocky pinnacle? In that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,case, how should I conduct myself? My arms were ready for use. Could I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not elude the necessity of shedding more blood? Could I not anticipate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their assault by casting myself without delay into the stream?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sense of danger demanded more attention to be paid to external
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,objects than to the motives by which my future conduct should be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,influenced. My post was on a circular prefecture, in some degree
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,detached from the body of the hill, the brow of which continued in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,straight line, uninterrupted by this projecture, which was somewhat
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,higher than the continued summit of the ridge. This line ran at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance of a few paces from my post. Objects moving along this line
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could merely be perceived to move, in the present obscurity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My scrutiny was entirely directed to this quarter. Presently the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,treading of many feet was heard, and several figures were discovered,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,following each other in that straight and regular succession which is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,peculiar to the Indians. They kept along the brow of the hill joining
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the promontory. I distinctly marked seven figures in succession.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My resolution was formed. Should any one cast his eye hither, suspect or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discover an enemy, and rush towards me, I determined to start upon my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,feet, fire on my foe as he advanced, throw my piece on the ground, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,then leap into the river.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Happily, they passed unobservant and in silence. I remained in the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,posture for several minutes. At length, just as my alarms began to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subside, the halloos, before heard, arose, and from the same quarter as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before. This convinced me that my perils were not at an end. This now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appeared to be merely the vanguard, and would speedily be followed by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,others, against whom the same caution was necessary to be taken.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My eye, anxiously bent the only way by which any one could approach, now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discerned a figure, which was indubitably that of a man armed. None
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,other appeared in company; but doubtless others were near. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,approached, stood still, and appeared to gaze steadfastly at the spot
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,where I lay.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The optics of a _Lenni-lennapee_ I knew to be far keener than my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,own. A log or a couched fawn would never be mistaken for a man, nor a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,man for a couched fawn or a log. Not only a human being would be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instantly detected, but a decision be unerringly made whether it wrere
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,friend or foe. That my prostrate body was the object on which the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attention of this vigilant and steadfast gazer was fixed could not be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,doubted. Yet, since he continued an inactive gazer, there was ground for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a possibility to stand upon that I was not recognised. My fate therefore
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was still in suspense.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This interval was momentary. I marked a movement, which my fears
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,instantly interpreted to be that of levelling a gun at my head. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,action was sufficiently conformable to my prognostics. Supposing me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be detected, there was no need for him to change his post. Aim might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,too fatally taken, and his prey be secured, from the distance at which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he now stood.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These images glanced upon my thought, and put an end to my suspense. A
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,single effort placed me on my feet. I fired with a precipitation that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precluded the certainty of hitting my mark, dropped my piece upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ground, and leaped from this tremendous height into the river. I reached
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the surface, and sunk in a moment to the bottom.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Plunging endlong into the water, the impetus created by my fall from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,such a height would be slowly resisted by this denser element. Had the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depth been less, its resistance would not perhaps have hindered me from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being mortally injured against the rocky bottom. Had the depth been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,greater, time enough would not have been allowed me to regain the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surface. Had I fallen on my side, I should have been bereft of life or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sensibility by the shock which my frame would have received. As it was,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my fate was suspended on a thread. To have lost my presence of mind, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have forborne to counteract my sinking, for an instant, after I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reached the water, would have made all exertions to regain the air
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fruitless. To so fortunate a concurrence of events was thy friend
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indebted for his safety!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Yet I only emerged from the gulf to encounter new perils. Scarcely had I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,raised my head above the surface, and inhaled the vital breath, when
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,twenty shots were aimed at me from the precipice above. A shower of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bullets fell upon the water. Some of them did not fall farther than two
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inches from my head. I had not been aware of this new danger, and, now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that it assailed me, continued gasping the air and floundering at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,random. The means of eluding it did not readily occur. My case seemed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,desperate, and all caution was dismissed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This state of discomfiting surprise quickly disappeared. I made myself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acquainted, at a glance, with the position of surrounding objects. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conceived that the opposite bank of the river would afford me most
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,security, and thither I tended with all the expedition in my power.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Meanwhile, my safety depended on eluding the bullets that continued
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incessantly to strike the water at an arm's-length from my body. For
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this end I plunged beneath the surface, and only rose to inhale fresh
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,air. Presently the firing ceased, the flashes that lately illuminated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the bank disappeared, and a certain bustle and murmur of confused voices
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gave place to solitude and silence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XXII.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I reached without difficulty the opposite bank, but the steep was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inaccessible. I swam along the edge in hopes of meeting with some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,projection or recess where I might, at least, rest my weary limbs, and,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,if it were necessary to recross the river, to lay in a stock of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recruited spirits and strength for that purpose. I trusted that the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,water would speedily become shoal, or that the steep would afford rest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to my feet. In both these hopes I was disappointed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There is no one to whom I would yield the superiority in swimming; but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my strength, like that of other human beings, had its limits. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,previous fatigues had been enormous, and my clothes, heavy with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moisture, greatly encumbered and retarded my movements. I had proposed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to free myself from this imprisonment; but I foresaw the inconveniences
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of wandering over this scene in absolute nakedness, and was willing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,therefore, at whatever hazard, to retain them. I continued to struggle
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with the current and to search for the means of scaling the steeps. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,search was fruitless, and I began to meditate the recrossing of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,river.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Surely my fate has never been paralleled! Where was this series of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hardships and perils to end? No sooner was one calamity eluded, than I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was beset by another. I had emerged from abhorred darkness in the heart
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the earth, only to endure the extremities of famine and encounter the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fangs of a wild beast. From these I was delivered only to be thrown into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the midst of savages, to wage an endless and hopeless war with adepts in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,killing, with appetites that longed to feast upon my bowels and to quaff
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my heart's blood. From these likewise was I rescued, but merely to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perish in the gulfs of the river, to welter on unvisited shores, or to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be washed far away from curiosity or pity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Formerly water was not only my field of sport but my sofa and my bed. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could float for hours on its surface, enjoying its delicious cool,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,almost without the expense of the slightest motion. It was an element as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fitted for repose as for exercise; but now the buoyant spirit seemed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have flown. My muscles were shrunk, the air and water were equally
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,congealed, and my most vehement exertions were requisite to sustain me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on the surface.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At first I had moved along with my wonted celerity and ease, but quickly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my forces were exhausted. My pantings and efforts were augmented, and I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,saw that to cross the river again was impracticable. I must continue,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,therefore, to search out some accessible spot in the bank along which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was swimming.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Each moment diminished my stock of strength, and it behooved me to make
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,good my footing before another minute should escape. I continued to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,swim, to survey the bank, and to make ineffectual attempts to grasp the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rock. The shrubs which grew upon it would not uphold me, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fragments which, for a moment, inspired me with hope, crumbled away as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,soon as they were touched.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At length I noticed a pine which was rooted in a crevice near the water.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The trunk, or any part of the root, was beyond my reach; but I trusted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I could catch hold of the branch which hung lowest, and that, when
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,caught, it would assist me in gaining the trunk, and thus deliver me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the death which could not be otherwise averted.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The attempt was arduous. Had it been made when I first reached the bank,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no difficulty had attended it; but now to throw myself some feet above
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the surface could scarcely be expected from one whose utmost efforts
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seemed to be demanded to keep him from sinking. Yet this exploit,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arduous as it was, was attempted and accomplished. Happily the twigs
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were strong enough to sustain my weight till I caught at other branches
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and finally placed myself upon the trunk.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This danger was now past; but I admitted the conviction that others, no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,less formidable, remained to be encountered, and that my ultimate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destiny was death. I looked upward. New efforts might enable me to gain
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the summit of this steep, but perhaps I should thus be placed merely in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the situation from which I had just been delivered. It was of little
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moment whether the scene of my imprisonment was a dungeon not to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,broken, or a summit from which descent was impossible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The river, indeed, severed me from a road which was level and safe, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my recent dangers were remembered only to make me shudder at the thought
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of incurring them a second time by attempting to cross it. I blush at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the recollection of this cowardice. It was little akin to the spirit
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which I had recently displayed. It was, indeed, an alien to my bosom,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and was quickly supplanted by intrepidity and perseverance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I proceeded to mount the hill. From root to root, and from branch to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,branch, lay my journey. It was finished, and I sat down upon the highest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brow to meditate on future trials. No road lay along this side of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,river. It was rugged and sterile, and farms were sparingly dispersed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,over it. To reach one of these was now the object of my wishes. I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not lost the desire of reaching Solesbury before morning, but my wet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,clothes and the coldness of the night seemed to have bereaved me of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,power.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I traversed this summit, keeping the river on my right hand. Happily,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,its declinations and ascents were by no means difficult, and I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cheered, in the midst of my vexations, by observing that every mile
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brought me nearer to my uncle's dwelling. Meanwhile I anxiously looked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for some tokens of a habitation. These at length presented themselves. A
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wild heath, whistled over by October blasts, meagrely adorned with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dry stalks of scented shrubs and the bald heads of the sapless mullein,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was succeeded by a fenced field and a corn-stack. The dwelling to which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,these belonged was eagerly sought.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was not surprised that all voices were still and all lights
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extinguished, for this was the hour of repose. Having reached a piazza
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before the house, I paused. Whether, at this drowsy time, to knock for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,admission, to alarm the peaceful tenants and take from them the rest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which their daily toils and their rural innocence had made so sweet, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to retire to what shelter a haystack or barn could afford, was the theme
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my deliberations.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Meanwhile, I looked up at the house. It was the model of cleanliness and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,comfort. It was built of wood; but the materials had undergone the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plane, as well as the axe and the saw. It was painted white, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,windows not only had sashes, but these sashes were supplied, contrary to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,custom, with glass. In most cases the aperture where glass should be is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stuffed with an old hat or a petticoat. The door had not only all its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,parts entire, but was embellished with mouldings and a pediment. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gathered from these tokens that this was the abode not only of rural
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,competence and innocence, but of some beings raised by education and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortune above the intellectual mediocrity of clowns.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Methought I could claim consanguity with such beings. Not to share their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,charity and kindness would be inflicting as well as receiving injury.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The trouble of affording shelter, and warmth, and wholesome diet, to a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wretch destitute as I was, would be eagerly sought by them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Still, I was unwilling to disturb them. I bethought myself that their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kitchen might be entered, and all that my necessities required be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obtained without interrupting their slumber. I needed nothing but the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,warmth which their kitchen-hearth would afford. Stretched upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bricks, I might dry my clothes, and perhaps enjoy some unmolested sleep,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in spite of presages of ill and the horrid remembrances of what I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,performed and endured. I believed that nature would afford a short
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,respite to my cares.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I went to the door of what appeared to be a kitchen. The door was wide
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,open. This circumstance portended evil. Though it be not customary to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lock or to bolt, it is still less usual to have entrances unclosed. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entered with suspicious steps, and saw enough to confirm my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,apprehensions. Several pieces of wood, half burned, lay in the midst of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the floor. They appeared to have been removed hither from the chimney,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,doubtless with a view to set fire to the whole building.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The fire had made some progress on the floor, but had been seasonably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extinguished by pailfuls of water thrown upon it. The floor was still
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deluged with wet: the pail, not emptied of all its contents, stood Upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the hearth. The earthen vessels and plates, whose proper place was the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dresser, were scattered in fragments in all parts of the room. I looked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,around me for some one to explain this scene, but no one appeared.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The last spark of fire was put out, so that, had my curiosity been idle,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my purpose could not be accomplished. To retire from this scene, neither
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,curiosity nor benevolence would permit. That some mortal injury had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intended was apparent. What greater mischief had befallen, or whether
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,greater might not, by my interposition, be averted, could only be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascertained by penetrating farther into the house. I opened a door on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,one side which led to the main body of the building and entered to a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bed-chamber. I stood at the entrance and knocked, but no one answered my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,signals.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sky was not totally clouded, so that some light pervaded the room. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,saw that a bed stood in the corner, but whether occupied or not its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,curtains hindered me from judging. I stood in suspense a few minutes,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,when a motion in the bed showed me that some one was there. I knocked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,again, but withdrew to the outside of the door. This roused the sleeper,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who, half groaning, and puffing the air through his nostrils, grumbled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,out, in the hoarsest voice that I ever heard, and in a tone of surly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impatience, "Who is there?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I hesitated for an answer; but the voice instantly continued, in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,manner of one half asleep and enraged at being disturbed, "Is't you,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Peg? Damn ye, stay away, now! I tell ye, stay away, or, by God, I will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cut your throat!--I will!" He continued to mutter and swear, but without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,coherence or distinctness.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These were the accents of drunkenness, and denoted a wild and ruffian
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life. They were little in unison with the external appearances of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mansion, and blasted all the hopes I had formed of meeting under this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,roof with gentleness and hospitality. To talk with this being, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attempt to reason him into humanity and soberness, was useless. I was at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a loss in what manner to address him, or whether it was proper to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maintain any parley. Meanwhile, my silence was supplied by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggestions of his own distempered fancy. "Ay," said he; "ye will, will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ye? Well, come on; let's see who's the better at the oak stick. If I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,part with ye before I have bared your bones!--I'll teach ye to be always
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dipping in my dish, ye devil's dam ye."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,So saying, he tumbled out of bed. At the first step, he struck his head
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,against the bedpost, but, setting himself upright, he staggered towards
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the spot where I stood. Some new obstacle occurred. He stumbled and fell
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at his length upon the floor.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To encounter or expostulate with a man in this state was plainly absurd.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I turned and issued forth, with an aching heart, into the court before
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the house. The miseries which a debauched husband or father inflicted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon all whom their evil destiny allies to him were pictured by my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fancy, and wrung from me tears of anguish, These images, however,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quickly yielded to reflections on my own state. No expedient now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remained but to seek the barn and find a covering and a bed of straw.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had scarcely set foot within the barnyard when I heard a sound as of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the crying of an infant. It appeared to issue from the barn. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,approached softly and listened at the door. The cries of the babe
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,continued, but were accompanied by the entreaties of a nurse or a mother
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to be quiet. These entreaties were mingled with heart-breaking sobs, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exclamations of, "Ah, me, my babe! Canst thou not sleep and afford thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unhappy mother some peace? Thou art cold, and I have not sufficient
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,warmth to cherish thee! What will become of us? Thy deluded father cares
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not if we both perish."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A glimpse of the true nature of the scene seemed to be imparted by these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,words. I now likewise recollected incidents that afforded additional
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,light. Somewhere on this bank of the river there formerly resided one by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,name Selby. He was an aged person, who united science and taste to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,simple and laborious habits of a husbandman. He had a son who resided
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,several years in Europe, but on the death of his father returned home,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accompanied by a wife. He had succeeded to the occupation of the farm,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but rumour had whispered many tales to the disadvantage of his morals.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His wife was affirmed to be of delicate and polished manners, and much
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unlike her companion.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It now occurred to me that this was the dwelling of the Selbys, and I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seemed to have gained some insight into the discord and domestic
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,miseries by which the unhappy lady suffered. This was no time to waste
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my sympathy on others. I could benefit her nothing. Selby had probably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,returned from a carousal, with all his malignant passions raised into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,frenzy by intoxication. He had driven his desolate wife from her bed and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,house, and, to shun outrage and violence, she had fled, with her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,helpless infant, to the barn. To appease his fury, to console her, to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggest a remedy for this distress, was not in my power. To have sought
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an interview would be merely to excite her terrors and alarm her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,delicacy, without contributing to alleviate her calamity. Here, then,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was no asylum for me. A place of rest must be sought at some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,neighbouring habitation. It was probable that one would be found at no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,great distance: the path that led from the spot where I stood, through a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gate, into a meadow, might conduct me to the nearest dwelling; and this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,path I immediately resolved to explore.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was anxious to open the gate without noise, but I could not succeed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some creaking of its hinges was unavoidably produced, which I feared
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would be overheard by the lady and multiply her apprehensions and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perplexities. This inconvenience was irremediable. I therefore closed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the gate and pursued the footway before me with the utmost expedition. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had not gained the farther end of the meadow when I lighted on something
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which lay across the path, and which, on being closely inspected,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appeared to be a human body. It was the corpse of a girl, mangled by a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hatchet. Her head, gory and deprived of its locks, easily explained the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kind of enemies by whom she had been assailed. Here was proof that this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,quiet and remote habitation had been visited, in their destructive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,progress, by the Indians. The girl had been slain by them, and her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scalp, according to their savage custom, had been torn away to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,preserved as a trophy.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The fire which had been kindled on the kitchen-floor tvas now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remembered, and corroborated the inferences which were drawn from this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spectacle. And yet that the mischief had been thus limited, that the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,besotted wretch who lay helpless on his bed and careless of impending
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,danger, and that the mother and her infant, should escape, excited some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,degree of surprise. Could the savages have been interrupted in their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,work, and obliged to leave their vengeance unfinished?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Their visit had been recent. Many hours had not elapsed since they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prowled about these grounds. Had they wholly disappeared, and meant they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not to return? To what new danger might I be exposed in remaining thus
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guideless and destitute of all defence?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In consequence of these reflections, I proceeded with more caution. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,looked with suspicious glances before and on either side of me. I now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,approached the fence which, on this side, bounded the meadow. Something
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was discerned, or imagined, stretched close to the fence, on the ground,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and filling up the pathway. My apprehensions of a lurking enemy had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,previously awakened, and my fancy instantly figured to itself an armed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,man lying on the ground and waiting to assail the unsuspecting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passenger.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At first I was prompted to fly, but a second thought showed me that I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had already approached near enough to be endangered. Notwithstanding my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pause, the form was motionless. The possibility of being misled in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conjectures was easily supposed. What I saw might be a log, or it might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be another victim to savage ferocity. This track was that which my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,safety required me to pursue. To turn aside or go back would be merely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to bewilder myself anew.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Urged by these motives, I went nearer, and at last was close enough to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perceive that the figure was human. He lay upon his face. Near his right
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hand was a musket, unclenched. This circumstance, his deathlike
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attitude, and the garb and ornaments of an Indian, made me readily
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspect the nature and cause of this catastrophe. Here the invaders had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been encountered and repulsed, and one at least of their number had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,left upon the field.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was weary of contemplating these rueful objects. Custom, likewise,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,even in so short a period, had inured me to spectacles of horror. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,grown callous and immovable. I stayed not to ponder on the scene, but,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,snatching the musket, which was now without an owner, and which might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indispensable to my defence, I hastened into the wood. On this side the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,meadow was skirted by a forest; but a beaten road led into it, and might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,therefore be attempted without danger.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XXIII.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The road was intricate and long. It seemed designed to pervade the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forest in every possible direction. I frequently noticed cut wood piled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in heaps upon either side, and rejoiced in these tokens that the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,residence of man was near. At length I reached a second fence, which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,proved to be the boundary of a road still more frequented. I pursued
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this, and presently beheld before me the river and its opposite
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,barriers.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This object afforded me some knowledge of my situation. There was a ford
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,over which travellers used to pass, and in which the road that I was now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pursuing terminated. The stream was rapid and tumultuous, but in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,place did not rise higher than the shoulders. On the opposite side was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,highway, passable by horses and men, though not by carriages, and which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,led into the midst of Solesbury. Should I not rush into the stream, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,still aim at reaching my uncle's house before morning? Why should I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,delay?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thirty hours of incessant watchfulness and toil, of enormous efforts and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perils, preceded and accompanied by abstinence and wounds, were enough
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to annihilate the strength and courage of ordinary men. In the course of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them, I had frequently believed myself to have reached the verge beyond
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which my force would not carry me; but experience as frequently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,demonstrated my error. Though many miles were yet to be traversed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,though my clothes were once more to be drenched and loaded with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moisture, though every hour seemed to add somewhat to the keenness of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the blast, yet how should I know, but by trial, whether my stock of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,energy was not sufficient for this last exploit?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My resolution to proceed was nearly formed, when the figure of a man
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moving slowly across the road at some distance before me was observed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Hard by this ford lived a man by name Bisset, of whom I had slight
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knowledge. He tended his two hundred acres with a plodding and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,money-doting spirit, while his son overlooked a grist-mill on the river.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He was a creature of gain, coarse and harmless. The man whom I saw before
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me might be he, or some one belonging to his family. Being armed for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,defence, I less scrupled at meeting with any thing in the shape of man.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I therefore called. The figure stopped and answered me without surliness
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or anger. The voice was unlike that of Bisset, but this person's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,information I believed would be of some service.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Coming up to him, he proved to be a clown belonging to Bisset's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,habitation. His panic and surprise on seeing me made him aghast. In my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,present garb I should not have easily been recognised by my nearest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kinsman, and much less easily by one who had seldom met me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It may be easily conceived that my thoughts, when allowed to wander from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the objects before me, were tormented with forebodings and inquietudes
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on account of the ills which I had so much reason to believe had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,befallen my family. I had no doubt that some evil had happened, but the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,full extent of it was still uncertain. I desired and dreaded to discover
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the truth, and was unable to interrogate this person in a direct manner.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I could deal only in circuities and hints. I shuddered while I waited
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for an answer to my inquiries.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Had not Indians, I asked, been lately seen in this neighbourhood? Were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they not suspected of hostile designs? Had they not already committed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some mischief? Some passenger, perhaps, had been attacked, or fire had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been set to some house? On which side of the river had their steps been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,observed or any devastation been committed? Above the ford or below it?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At what distance from the river?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,When his attention could be withdrawn from my person and bestowed upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my questions, he answered that some alarm had indeed been spread about
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Indians, and that parties from Solesbury and Chetasco were out in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pursuit of them, that many persons had been killed by them, and that one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,house in Solesbury had been rifled and burnt on the night before the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,last.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These tidings were a dreadful confirmation of my fears. There scarcely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remained a doubt; but still my expiring hope prompted me to inquire, "To
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom did the house belong?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He answered that he had not heard the name of the owner. He was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stranger to the people on the other side of the river.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Were any of the inhabitants murdered?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Yes; all that were at home, except a girl whom they carried off. Some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,said that the girl had been retaken.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What was the name? Was it Huntly?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Huntly? Yes. No. He did not know. He had forgotten.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I fixed my eyes upon the ground. An interval of gloomy meditation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,succeeded. All was lost! All for whose sake I had desired to live had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perished by the hands of these assassins! That dear home, the scene of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my sportive childhood, of my studies, labours, and recreations, was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ravaged by fire and the sword,--was reduced to a frightful ruin!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Not only all that embellished and endeared existence was destroyed, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the means of subsistence itself. Thou knowest that my sisters and I were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dependants on the bounty of our uncle. His death would make way for the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,succession of his son, a man fraught with envy and malignity, who always
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,testified a mortal hatred to us, merely because we enjoyed the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,protection of his father. The ground which furnished me with bread was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now become the property of one who, if he could have done it with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,security, would gladly have mingled poison with my food.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,All that my imagination or my heart regarded as of value had likewise
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perished. Whatever my chamber, my closets, my cabinets contained, my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,furniture, my books, the records of my own skill, the monuments of their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,existence whom I loved, my very clothing, were involved in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indiscriminate and irretrievable destruction. Why should I survive this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,calamity?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But did not he say that one had escaped? The only females in the family
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were my sisters. One of these had been reserved for a fate worse than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,death; to gratify the innate and insatiable cruelty of savages, by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suffering all the torments their invention can suggest, or to linger out
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,years of weary bondage and unintermitted hardship in the bosom of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wilderness. To restore her to liberty, to cherish this last survivor of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my unfortunate race, was a sufficient motive to life and to activity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But soft! Had not rumour whispered that the captive was retaken? Oh! who
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was her angel of deliverance? Where did she now abide? Weeping over the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,untimely fall of her protector and her friend? Lamenting and upbraiding
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the absence of her brother? Why should I not haste to find her?--to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mingle my tears with hers, to assure her of my safety, and expatiate the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,involuntary crime of my desertion by devoting all futurity to the task
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her consolation and improvement?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The path was open and direct. My new motives would have trampled upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,every impediment and made me reckless of all dangers and all toils. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,broke from my reverie, and, without taking leave or expressing gratitude
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to my informant, I ran with frantic expedition towards the river, and,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plunging into it, gained the opposite side in a moment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was sufficiently acquainted with the road. Some twelve or fifteen
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,miles remained to be traversed. I did not fear that my strength would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fail in the performance of my journey. It was not my uncle's habitation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to which I directed my steps. Inglefield was my friend. If my sister had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,existence, or was snatched from captivity, it was here that an asylum
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been afforded to her, and here was I to seek the knowledge of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destiny. For this reason, having reached a spot where the road divided
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into two branches, one of which led to Inglefield's and the other to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Huntly's, I struck into the former.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Scarcely had I passed the angle when I noticed a building on the right
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hand, at some distance from the road. In the present state of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thoughts, it would not have attracted my attention, had not a light
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gleamed from an upper window and told me that all within were not at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rest.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was acquainted with the owner of this mansion. He merited esteem and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confidence, and could not fail to be acquainted with recent events. From
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him I should obtain all the information that I needed, and I should be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,delivered from some part of the agonies of my suspense. I should reach
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his door in a few minutes, and the window-light was a proof that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entrance at this hour would not disturb the family, some of whom were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stirring.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Through a gate I entered an avenue of tall oaks, that led to the house.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I could not but reflect on the effect which my appearance would produce
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon the family. The sleek locks, neat apparel, pacific guise, sobriety
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and gentleness of aspect by which I was customarily distinguished, would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in vain be sought in the apparition which would now present itself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before them. My legs, neck, and bosom were bare, and their native hue
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was exchanged for the livid marks of bruises and scarifications. A
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,horrid scar upon my cheek, and my uncombed locks; hollow eyes, made
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ghastly by abstinence and cold, and the ruthless passions of which my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mind had been the theatre, added to the musket which I carried in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hand, would prepossess them with the notion of a maniac or ruffian.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some inconveniences might hence arise, which, however, could not be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,avoided. I must trust to the speed with which my voice and my words
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should disclose my true character and rectify their mistake.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now reached the principal door of the house. It was open, and I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unceremoniously entered. In the midst of the room stood a German stove,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,well heated. To thaw my half-frozen limbs was my first care. Meanwhile I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gazed around me, and marked the appearances of things.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Two lighted candles stood upon the table. Beside them were cider-bottles
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and pipes of tobacco. The furniture and room was in that state which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,denoted it to have been lately filled with drinkers and smokers; yet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,neither voice, nor visage, nor motion, were anywhere observable. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,listened; but neither above nor below, within nor without, could any
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tokens of a human being be perceived.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This vacancy and silence must have been lately preceded by noise, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,concourse, and bustle. The contrast was mysterious and ambiguous. No
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,adequate cause of so quick and absolute a transition occurred to me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Having gained some warmth and lingered some ten or twenty minutes in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this uncertainty, I determined to explore the other apartments of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,building. I knew not what might betide in my absence, or what I might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,encounter in my search to justify precaution, and, therefore, kept the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gun in my hand. I snatched a candle from the table and proceeded into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,two other apartments on the first floor and the kitchen. Neither was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inhabited, though chairs and tables were arranged in their usual order,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and no traces of violence or hurry were apparent.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Having gained the foot of the staircase, I knocked, but my knocking was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wholly disregarded. A light had appeared in an upper chamber. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not, indeed, in one of those apartments which the family permanently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occupied, but in that which, according to rural custom, was reserved for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guests; but it indubitably betokened the presence of some being by whom
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my doubts might be solved. These doubts were too tormenting to allow of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scruples and delay. I mounted the stairs.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At each chamber-door I knocked, but I knocked in vain. I tried to open,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but found them to be locked. I at length reached the entrance of that in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which a light had been discovered. Here it was certain that some one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would be found; but here, as well as elsewhere, my knocking was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unnoticed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To enter this chamber was audacious, but no other expedient was afforded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me to determine whether the house had any inhabitants. I therefore
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entered, though with caution and reluctance. No one was within, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,there were sufficient traces of some person who had lately been here. On
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the table stood a travelling-escritoire, open, with pens and inkstand. A
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chair was placed before it, and a candle on the right hand. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,apparatus was rarely seen in this country. Some traveller, it seemed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occupied this room, though the rest of the mansion was deserted. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pilgrim, as these appearances testified, was of no vulgar order, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,belonged not to the class of periodical and every-day guests.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It now occurred to me that the occupant of this apartment could not be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,far off, and that some danger and embarrassment could not fail to accrue
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from being found, thus accoutred and garbed, in a place sacred to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,study and repose of another. It was proper, therefore, to withdraw, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,either to resume my journey, or wait for the stranger's return, whom
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perhaps some temporary engagement had called away, in the lower and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,public room. The former now appeared to be the best expedient, as the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,return of this unknown person was uncertain, as well as his power to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,communicate the information which I wanted.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Had paper, as well as the implements of writing, lain upon the desk,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perhaps my lawless curiosity would not have scrupled to have pried into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it. On the first glance nothing of that kind appeared; but now, as I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,turned towards the door, somewhat, lying beside the desk, on the side
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opposite the candle, caught my attention. The impulse was instantaneous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and mechanical that made me leap to the spot and lay my hand upon it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Till I felt it between my fingers, till I brought it near my eyes and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,read frequently the inscriptions that appeared upon it, I was doubtful
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whether my senses had deceived me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Few, perhaps, among mankind, have undergone vicissitudes of peril and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wonder equal to mine. The miracles of poetry, the transitions of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enchantment, are beggarly and mean compared with those which I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,experienced. Passage into new forms, overleaping the bars of time and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,space, reversal of the laws of inanimate and intelligent existence, had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been mine to perform and to witness.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,No event had been more fertile of sorrow and perplexity than the loss of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thy brother's letters. They went by means invisible, and disappeared at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a moment when foresight would have least predicted their disappearance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,They now placed themselves before me, in a manner equally abrupt, in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,place and by means no less contrary to expectation. The papers which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now seized were those letters. The parchment cover, the string that tied
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the wax that sealed them, appeared not to have been opened or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,violated.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The power that removed them, from my cabinet, and dropped them in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,house,--a house which I rarely visited, which I had not entered during
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the last year, with whose inhabitants I maintained no cordial
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intercourse, and to whom my occupations and amusements, my joys and my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sorrows, were unknown,--was no object even of conjecture. But they were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not possessed by any of the family. Some stranger was here, by whom they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been stolen, or into whose possession they had, by some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incomprehensible chance, fallen.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That stranger was near. He had left this apartment for a moment. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would speedily return. To go hence might possibly occasion me to miss
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him. Here, then, I would wait, till he should grant me an interview. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,papers were mine, and were recovered. I would never part with them. But
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to know by whose force or by whose stratagems I had been bereaved of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them thus long, was now the supreme passion of my soul. I seated myself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,near a table and anxiously waited for an interview, on which I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,irresistibly persuaded to believe that much of my happiness depended.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Meanwhile, I could not but connect this incident with the destruction of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my family. The loss of these papers had excited transports of grief; and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,yet to have lost them thus was perhaps the sole expedient by which their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,final preservation could be rendered possible. Had they, remained in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cabinet, they could not have escaped the destiny which overtook the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,house and its furniture. Savages are not accustomed to leave their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,exterminating work unfinished. The house which they have plundered they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,are careful to level with the ground. This not only their revenge, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their caution, prescribes. Fire may originate by accident as well as by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,design, and the traces of pillage and murder are totally obliterated by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the flames.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These thoughts were interrupted by the shutting of a door below, and by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,footsteps ascending the stairs. My heart throbbed at the sound. My seat
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,became uneasy and I started on my feet. I even advanced half-way to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entrance of the room. My eyes were intensely fixed upon the door. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,impatience would have made me guess at the person of this visitant by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,measuring his shadow, if his shadow were first seen; but this was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precluded by the position of the light. It was only when the figure
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entered, and the whole person was seen, that my curiosity was gratified.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He who stood before me was the parent and fosterer of my mind, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,companion and instructor of my youth, from whom I had been parted for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,years, from whom I believed myself to be forever separated,--Sarsefield
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,himself!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XXIV.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My deportment, at an interview so much desired and so wholly unforeseen,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was that of a maniac. The petrifying influence of surprise yielded to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the impetuosities of passion. I held him in my arms; I wept upon his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bosom; I sobbed with emotion which, had it not found passage at my eyes,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would have burst my heart-strings. Thus I, who had escaped the deaths
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that had previously assailed me in so many forms, should have been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reserved to solemnize a scene like this by--_dying for joy_!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sterner passions and habitual austerities of my companion exempted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him from pouring out this testimony of his feelings. His feelings were,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indeed, more allied to astonishment and incredulity than mine had been.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My person was not instantly recognised. He shrunk from my embrace as if
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I were an apparition or impostor. He quickly disengaged himself from my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arms, and, withdrawing a few paces, gazed upon me as on one whom he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,never before seen.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These repulses were ascribed to the loss of his affection. I was not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mindful of the hideous guise in which I stood before him, and by which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he might justly be misled to imagine me a ruffian or a lunatic. My tears
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flowed now on a new account, and I articulated, in a broken and faint
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,voice, "My master! my friend! Have you forgotten, have you ceased to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,love me?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sound of my voice made him start and exclaim, "Am I alive? am I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,awake? Speak again, I beseech you, and convince me that I am not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dreaming or delirious."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Can you need any proof," I answered, "that it is Edgar Huntly, your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pupil, your child, that speaks to you?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He now withdrew his eyes from me and fixed them on the floor. After a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pause he resumed, in emphatic accents:--"Well, I have lived to this age
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in unbelief. To credit or trust in miraculous agency was foreign to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nature, but now I am no longer skeptical. Call me to any bar, and exact
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from me an oath that you have twice been dead and twice recalled to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life; that you move about invisibly, and change your place by the force,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not of muscles, but of thought, and I will give it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"How came you hither? Did you penetrate the wall? Did you rise through
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the floor?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Yet surely 'tis an error. You could not be he whom twenty witnesses
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,affirmed to have beheld a lifeless and mangled corpse upon the ground,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom my own eyes saw in that condition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"In seeking the spot once more to provide you a grave, you had vanished.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Again I met you. You plunged into a rapid stream, from a height from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which it was impossible to fall and to live; yet, as if to set the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,limits of nature at defiance, to sport with human penetration, you rose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon the surface; you floated; you swam; thirty bullets were aimed at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your head, by marksmen celebrated for the exactness of their sight. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,myself was of the number, and I never missed what I desired to hit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My predictions were confirmed by the event. You ceased to struggle; you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sunk to rise no more; and yet, after these accumulated deaths, you light
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon this floor, so far distant from the scene of your catastrophe, over
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spaces only to be passed, in so short a time as has since elapsed, by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,those who have wings.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My eyes, my ears, bear testimony to your existence now, as they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,formerly convinced me of your death. What am I to think? what proofs am
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I to credit?" There he stopped.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Every accent of this speech added to the confusion of my thoughts. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,allusions that my friend had made were not unintelligible. I gained a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,glimpse of the complicated errors by which we had been mutually
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deceived. I had fainted on the area before Deb's hut. I was found by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield in this condition, and imagined to be dead.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The man whom I had seen upon the promontory was not an Indian. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,belonged to a numerous band of pursuers, whom my hostile and precipitate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deportment caused to suspect me for an enemy. They that fired from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steep were friends. The interposition that screened me from so many
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bullets was indeed miraculous. No wonder that my voluntary sinking, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,order to elude their shots, was mistaken for death, and that, having
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accomplished the destruction of this foe, they resumed their pursuit of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,others. But how was Sarsefield apprized that it was I who plunged into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the river? No subsequent event was possible to impart to him the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incredible truth.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A pause of mutual silence ensued. At length Sarsefield renewed his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expressions of amazement at this interview, and besought me to explain
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,why I had disappeared by night from my uncle's house, and by what series
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of unheard-of events this interview was brought about. Was it indeed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Huntly whom he examined and mourned over at the threshold of Deb's hut.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Whom he had sought in every thicket and cave in the ample circuit of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Norwalk and Chetasco? Whom he had seen perish in the current of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Delaware?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Instead of noticing his questions, my soul was harrowed with anxiety
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,respecting the fate of my uncle and sisters. Sarsefield could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,communicate the tidings which would decide on my future lot and set my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,portion in happiness or misery. Yet I had not breath to speak my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inquiries. Hope tottered, and I felt as if a single word would be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficient for its utter subversion. At length I articulated the name of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my uncle.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The single word sufficiently imparted my fears, and these fears needed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no verbal confirmation. At that dear name my companion's features were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,overspread by sorrow.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Your uncle," said he, "is dead."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Dead? Merciful Heaven! And my sisters too! Both?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Your sisters are alive and well."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Nay," resumed I, in faltering accents, "jest not with my feelings. Be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not cruel in your pity. Tell me the truth."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I have said the truth. They are well, at Mr. Inglefield's."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My wishes were eager to assent to the truth of these tidings. The better
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,part of me was, then, safe: but how did they escape the fate that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,overtook my uncle? How did they evade the destroying hatchet and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,midnight conflagration? These doubts were imparted in a tumultuous and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obscure manner to my friend. He no sooner fully comprehended them, than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he looked at me with some inquietude and surprise.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Huntly," said he, "are you mad? What has filled you with these hideous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prepossessions? Much havoc has indeed been committed in Chetasco and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wilderness, and a log hut has been burnt, by design or by accident, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Solesbury; but that is all. Your house has not been assailed by either
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,firebrand or tomahawk. Every thing is safe and in its ancient order. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,master indeed is gone, but the old man fell a victim to his own temerity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and hardihood. It is thirty years since he retired with three wounds
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the field of Braddock; but time in no degree abated his adventurous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and military spirit. On the first alarm, he summoned his neighbours, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,led them in pursuit of the invaders. Alas! he was the first to attack
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them, and the only one who fell in the contest."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These words were uttered in a manner that left me no room to doubt of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their truth. My uncle had already been lamented, and the discovery of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the nature of his death, so contrary to my forebodings, and of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,safety of my girls, made the state of my mind partake more of exultation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and joy than of grief or regret.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But how was I deceived? Had not my fusil been found in the hands of an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enemy? Whence could he have plundered it but from my own chamber? It
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hung against the wall of a closet, from which no stranger could have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,taken it except by violence. My perplexities and doubts were not at an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,end, but those which constituted my chief torment were removed. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,listened to my friend's entreaties to tell him the cause of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,elopement, and the incidents that terminated in the present interview.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I began with relating my return to consciousness in the bottom of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pit; my efforts to free myself from this abhorred prison; the acts of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,horror to which I was impelled by famine, and their excruciating
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequences; my gaining the outlet of the cavern, the desperate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expedient by which I removed the impediment to my escape, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deliverance of the captive girl; the contest I maintained before Deb's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hut; my subsequent wanderings; the banquet which hospitality afforded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me; my journey to the river-bank; my meditations on the means of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reaching the road; my motives for hazarding my life by plunging into the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stream; and my subsequent perils and fears till I reached the threshold
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of this habitation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Thus," continued I, "I have complied with your request. I have told all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that I myself know. What were the incidents between my sinking to rest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at my uncle's and my awaking in the chambers of the hill; by what means
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and by whose contrivance, preternatural or human, this transition was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,effected, I am unable to explain; I cannot even guess.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What has eluded my sagacity may not be beyond the reach of another.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Your own reflections on my tale, or some facts that have fallen under
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your notice, may enable you to furnish a solution. But, meanwhile, how
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,am I to account for your appearance on this spot? This meeting was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unexpected and abrupt to you, but it has not been less so to me. Of all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mankind, Sarsefield was the furthest from my thoughts when I saw these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tokens of a traveller and a stranger.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"You were imperfectly acquainted with my wanderings. You saw me on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ground before Deb's hut. You saw me plunge into the river. You
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,endeavoured to destroy me while swimming; and you knew, before my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,narrative was heard, that Huntly was the object of your enmity. What was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the motive of your search in the desert, and how were you apprized of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,condition? These things are not less wonderful that any of those which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have already related."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,During my tale the features of Sarsefield betokened the deepest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,attention. His eye strayed not a moment from my face. All my perils and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forebodings were fresh in my remembrance: they had scarcely gone by;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their skirts, so to speak, were still visible. No wonder that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eloquence was vivid and pathetic; that I portrayed the past as if it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were the present scene; and that not my tongue only, but every muscle
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and limb, spoke.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,When I had finished my relation, Sarsefield sank into thoughtfulness.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,From this, after a time, he recovered, and said, "Your tale, Huntly, is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,true; yet, did I not see you before me, were I not acquainted with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,artlessness and rectitude of your character, and, above all, had not my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,own experience, during the last three days, confirmed every incident, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should question its truth. You have amply gratified my curiosity, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deserve that your own should be gratified as fully. Listen to me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Much has happened since we parted, which shall not be now mentioned. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,promised to inform you of my welfare by letter, and did not fail to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,write; but whether my letters were received, or any were written by you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in return, or if written were ever transmitted, I cannot tell: none were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ever received.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Some days since, I arrived, in company with a lady who is my wife, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,America. You have never been forgotten by me. I knew your situation to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be little in agreement with your wishes, and one of the benefits which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortune has lately conferred upon me is the power of snatching you from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a life of labour and obscurity, whose goods, scanty as they are, were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,transient and precarious, and affording you the suitable leisure and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means of intellectual gratification and improvement.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Your silence made me entertain some doubts concerning your welfare, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,even your existence. To solve these doubts, I hastened to Solesbury.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some delays upon the road hindered me from accomplishing my journey by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,daylight. It was night before I entered the Norwalk path; but my ancient
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rambles with you made me familiar with it, and I was not afraid of being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obstructed or bewildered.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Just as I gained the southern outlet, I spied a passenger on foot,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,coming towards me with a quick pace. The incident was of no moment; and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,yet the time of night, the seeming expedition of the walker,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recollection of the mazes and obstacles which he was going to encounter,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and a vague conjecture that perhaps he was unacquainted with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,difficulties that awaited him, made me eye him with attention as he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"He came near, and I thought I recognised a friend in this traveller.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The form, the gesture, the stature, bore a powerful resemblance to those
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of Edgar Huntly. This resemblance was so strong, that I stopped, and,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,after he had gone by, called him by your name. That no notice was taken
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my call proved that the person was mistaken; but, even though it were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,another, that he should not even hesitate or turn at a summons which he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could not but perceive to be addressed, though erroneously, to him, was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the source of some surprise. I did not repeat my call, but proceeded on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my way.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"All had retired to repose in your uncle's dwelling. I did not scruple
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to rouse them, and was received with affectionate and joyous greetings.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That you allowed your uncle to rise before you was a new topic of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reflection. To my inquiries concerning you, answers were made that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accorded with my wishes. I was told that you were in good health and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were then in bed. That you had not heard and risen at my knocking was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mentioned with surprise; but your uncle accounted for your indolence by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,saying that during the last week you had fatigued yourself by rambling,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,night and day, in search of some maniac or visionary who was supposed to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have retreated into Norwalk.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I insisted upon awakening you myself. I anticipated the effect of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sudden and unlooked-for meeting with some emotions of pride as well as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of pleasure. To find, in opening your eyes, your old preceptor standing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by your bedside and gazing in your face, would place you, I conceived,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in an affecting situation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Your chamber-door was open, but your bed was empty. Your uncle and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sisters were made acquainted with this circumstance. Their surprise gave
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,way to conjectures that your restless and romantic spirit had tempted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you from your repose, that you had rambled abroad on some fantastic
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,errand, and would probably return before the dawn. I willingly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,acquiesced in this opinion, and, my feelings being too thoroughly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,aroused to allow me to sleep, I took possession of your chamber and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,patiently awaited your return.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The morning returned, but Huntly made not his appearance. Your uncle
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,became somewhat uneasy at this unseasonable absence. Much speculation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and inquiry as to the possible reasons of your flight was made. In my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,survey of your chamber, I noted that only part of your clothing remained
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beside your bed. Coat, hat, stockings and shoes lay upon the spot where
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,they had probably been thrown when you had disrobed yourself; but the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pantaloons, which, according to Mr. Huntly's report, completed your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dress, were nowhere to be found. That you should go forth on so cold a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,night so slenderly apparelled, was almost incredible. Your reason or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your senses had deserted you, before so rash an action could be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,meditated.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I now remembered the person I had met in Norwalk. His resemblance to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your figure, his garb, which wanted hat, coat, stockings and shoes, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your absence from your bed at that hour, were remarkable coincidences:
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but why did you disregard my call? Your name, uttered by a voice that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could not be unknown, was surely sufficient to arrest your steps.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Each hour added to the impatience of your friends. To their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recollections and conjectures I listened with a view to extract from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them some solution of this mystery. At length a story was alluded to of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some one who, on the preceding night, had been heard walking in the long
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,room: to this was added the tale of your anxieties and wonders
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasioned by the loss of certain manuscripts.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"While ruminating upon these incidents, and endeavouring to extract from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this intelligence a clue explanatory of your present situation, a single
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,word, casually dropped by your uncle, instantly illuminated my darkness
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and dispelled my doubts.--'After all,' said the old man, 'ten to one but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Edgar himself was the man whom we heard walking, but the lad was asleep,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and knew not what he was about.'
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"'Surely,' said I, 'this inference is just. His manuscripts could not be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,removed by any hands but his own, since the rest of mankind were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unacquainted not only with the place of their concealment, but with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their existence. None but a man insane or asleep would wander forth so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,slightly dressed, and none but a sleeper would have disregarded my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,calls.' This conclusion was generally adopted; but it gave birth in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mind to infinite inquietudes. You had roved into Norwalk, a scene of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inequalities, of prominences and pits, among which, thus destitute of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the guidance of your senses, you could scarcely fail to be destroyed,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,or, at least, irretrievably bewildered. I painted to myself the dangers
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to which you were subjected. Your careless feet would bear you into some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whirlpool or to the edge of some precipice; some internal revolution or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,outward shock would recall you to consciousness at some perilous moment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Surprise and fear would disable you from taking seasonable or suitable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precautions, and your destruction be made sure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The lapse of every new hour, without bringing tidings of your state,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enhanced these fears. At length the propriety of searching for you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occurred; Mr. Huntly and I determined to set out upon this pursuit, as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,well as to commission others. A plan was laid by which every accessible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,part of Norwalk, the wilderness beyond the flats of Solesbury, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,valley of Chetasco, should be traversed and explored.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Scarcely had we equipped ourselves for this expedition, when a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,messenger arrived, who brought the disastrous news of Indians being seen
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,within these precincts, and on the last night a farmer was shot in his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fields, a dwelling in Chetasco was burnt to the ground, and its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inhabitants murdered or made captives. Rumour and inquiry had been busy,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and a plausible conjecture had been formed as to the course and number
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of the enemies. They were said to be divided into bands, and to amount
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the whole to thirty or forty warriors. This messenger had come to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,warn us of danger which might impend, and to summon us to join in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pursuit and extirpation of these detestable foes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Your uncle, whose alacrity and vigour age had not abated, eagerly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,engaged in this scheme. I was not averse to contribute my efforts to an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,end like this. The road which we had previously designed to take, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,search of my fugitive pupil, was the same by which we must trace or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intercept the retreat of the savages. Thus two purposes, equally
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,momentous, would be answered by the same means.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Mr. Huntly armed himself with your fusil; Inglefield supplied me with a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gun. During our absence the dwelling was closed and locked, and your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sisters placed under the protection of Inglefield, whose age and pacific
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sentiments unfitted him for arduous and sanguinary enterprises. A troop
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of rustics was collected, half of whom remained to traverse Solesbury,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the other, whom Mr. Huntly and I accompanied, hastened to Chetasco."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XXV.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"It was noonday before we reached the theatre of action. Fear and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,revenge combined to make the people of Chetasco diligent and zealous in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,their own defence. The havoc already committed had been mournful. To
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prevent a repetition of the same calamities, they resolved to hunt out
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the hostile footsteps and exact a merciless retribution.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"It was likely that the enemy, on the approach of day, had withdrawn
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the valley and concealed themselves in the thickets between the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,parallel ridges of the mountain. This space, which, according to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,object with which it is compared, is either a vale or the top of a hill,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was obscure and desolate. It was undoubtedly the avenue by which the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,robbers had issued forth, and by which they would escape to the Ohio.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Here they might still remain, intending to emerge from their concealment
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,on the next night and perpetrate new horrors.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"A certain distribution was made of our number, so as to move in all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,directions at the same time. I will not dwell upon particulars. It will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suffice to say that keen eyes and indefatigable feet brought us at last
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the presence of the largest number of these marauders. Seven of them
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were slain by the edge of a brook, where they sat wholly unconscious of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the danger which hung over them. Five escaped, and one of these secured
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his retreat by wresting your fusil from your uncle and shooting him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dead. Before our companion could be rescued or revenged, the assassin,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with the remnant of the troop, disappeared, and bore away with him the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fusil as a trophy of his victory.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This disaster was deplored, not only on account of that life which had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thus been sacrificed, but because a sagacious guide and intrepid leader
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was lost. His acquaintance with the habits of the Indians, and his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,experience in their wars, made him trace their footsteps with more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,certainty than any of his associates.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The pursuit was still continued, and parties were so stationed that the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,escape of the enemy was difficult, if not impossible. Our search was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unremitted, but, during twelve or fourteen hours, unsuccessful. Queen
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Mab did not elude all suspicion. Her hut was visited by different
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,parties, but the old woman and her dogs had disappeared.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Meanwhile your situation was not forgotten. Every one was charged to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,explore your footsteps as well as those of the savages; but this search
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was no less unsuccessful than the former. None had heard of you or seen
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This continued till midnight. Three of us made a pause at a brook, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intended to repair our fatigues by a respite of a few hours; but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,scarcely had we stretched ourselves on the ground when we were alarmed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by a shot which seemed to have been fired at a short distance. We
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,started on our feet and consulted with each other on the measures to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,taken. A second, a third, and a fourth shot, from the same quarter,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,excited our attention anew. Mab's hut was known to stand at the distance
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and in the direction of this sound, and thither we resolved to repair.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This was done with speed, but with the utmost circumspection. We
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shortly gained the road that leads near this hut, and at length gained a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,view of the building. Many persons were discovered, in a sort of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bustling inactivity, before the hut. They were easily distinguished to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be friends, and were therefore approached without scruple.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The objects that presented themselves to a nearer view were five bodies
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stretched upon the ground. Three of them were savages. The fourth was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,girl, who, though alive, seemed to have received a mortal wound. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fifth, breathless and mangled, and his features almost concealed by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,blood that overspread his face, was Edgar,--the fugitive for whom I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,made such anxious search.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"About the same hour on the last night I had met you hastening into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Norwalk. Now were you lying in the midst of savages, at the distance of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thirty miles from your home, and in a spot which it was impossible for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you to have reached unless by an immense circuit over rocks and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thickets. That you had found a rift at the basis of a hill, and thus
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,penetrated its solidities, and thus precluded so tedious and circuitous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a journey as must otherwise have been made, was not to be imagined.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"But whence arose this scene? It was obvious to conclude that my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,associates had surprised their enemies in this house, and exacted from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them the forfeit of their crimes; but how you should have been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confounded with their foes, or whence came the wounded girl, was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subject of astonishment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"You will judge how much this surprise was augmented when I was informed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that the party whom we found had been attracted hither by the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,signals by which we had been alarmed. That on reaching this spot you had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been discovered, alive, seated on the ground, and still sustaining the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gun with which you had apparently completed the destruction of so many
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,adversaries. In a moment after their arrival you sunk down and expired.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This scene was attended with inexplicable circumstances. The musket
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which lay beside you appeared to have belonged to one of the savages.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The wound by which each had died was single. Of the four shots we had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distinguished at a distance, three of them were therefore fatal to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Indians, and the fourth was doubtless that by which you had fallen; yet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,three muskets only were discoverable.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The arms were collected, and the girl carried to the nearest house in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the arms of her father. Her situation was deemed capable of remedy, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the sorrow and wonder which I felt at your untimely and extraordinary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fate did not hinder me from endeavouring to restore the health of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unfortunate victim. I reflected, likewise, that some light might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thrown upon transactions so mysterious by the information which might be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,collected from her story. Numberless questions and hints were necessary
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to extract from her a consistent or intelligible tale. She had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dragged, it seems, for miles, at the heels of her conquerors, who at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,length stopped in a cavern for the sake of some repose. All slept but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,one, who sat and watched. Something called him away, and, at the same
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moment, you appeared at the bottom of the cave, half naked and without
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arms. You instantly supplied the last deficiency by seizing the gun and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tomahawk of him who had gone forth, and who had negligently left his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,weapons behind. Then, stepping over the bodies of the sleepers, you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rushed out of the cavern.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"She then mentioned your unexpected return, her deliverance and flight,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and arrival at Deb's hut. You watched upon the hearth, and she fell
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,asleep upon the blanket. From this sleep she was aroused by violent and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cruel blows. She looked up: you were gone, and the bed on which she lay
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was surrounded by the men from whom she had so lately escaped. One
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dragged her out of the hut and levelled his gun at her breast. At the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moment when he touched the trigger, a shot came from an unknown quarter,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and he fell at her feet. Of subsequent events she had an incoherent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recollection. The Indians were successively slain, and you came to her,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and interrogated and consoled her.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"In your journey to the hut you were armed. This in some degree
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accounted for appearances: but where were your arms? Three muskets only
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were discovered, and these undoubtedly belonged to your enemies.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I now had leisure to reflect upon your destiny. I had arrived soon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enough on this shore merely to witness the catastrophe of two beings
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom I most loved. Both were overtaken by the same fate, nearly at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,same hour. The same hand had possibly accomplished the destruction of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uncle and nephew.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Now, however, I began to entertain a hope that your state might not be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,irretrievable. You had walked and spoken after the firing had ceased and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your enemies had ceased to contend with you. A wound had, no doubt, been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,previously received. I had hastily inferred that the wound was mortal,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and that life could not be recalled. Occupied with attention to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wailings of the girl, and full of sorrow and perplexity, I had admitted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,an opinion which would have never been adopted in different
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,circumstances. My acquaintance with wounds would have taught me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regard sunken muscles, lividness, and cessation of the pulse, as mere
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indications of a swoon, and not as tokens of death.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Perhaps my error was not irreparable. By hastening to the hut, I might
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascertain your condition, and at least transport your remains to some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dwelling and finally secure to you the decencies of burial.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Of twelve savages discovered on the preceding day, ten were now killed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Two at least remained, after whom the pursuit was still zealously
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,maintained. Attention to the wounded girl had withdrawn me from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,party, and I had now leisure to return to the scene of these disasters.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sun had risen, and, accompanied by two others, I repaired thither.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"A sharp turn in the road, at the entrance of a field, set before us a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,startling spectacle. An Indian, mangled by repeated wounds of bayonet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and bullet, was discovered. His musket was stuck in the ground, by way
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of beacon attracting our attention to the spot. Over this space I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gone a few hours before, and nothing like this was then seen. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,parties abroad had hied away to a distant quarter. Some invisible power
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seemed to be enlisted in our defence and to preclude the necessity of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,our arms.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"We proceeded to the hut. The savages were there, but Edgar had risen
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and flown! Nothing now seemed to be incredible. You had slain three
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,foes, and the weapon with which the victory had been achieved had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vanished. You had risen from the dead, had assailed one of the surviving
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enemies, had employed bullet and dagger in his destruction, with both of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which you could only be supplied by supernatural means, and had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappeared. If any inhabitant of Chetasco had done this, we should have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,heard of it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"But what remained? You were still alive. Your strength was sufficient
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to bear you from this spot. Why were you still invisible? and to what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dangers might you not be exposed before you could disinvolve yourself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from the mazes of this wilderness?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Once more I procured indefatigable search to be made after you. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,continued till the approach of evening, and was fruitless. Inquiries
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were twice made at the house where you were supplied with food and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intelligence. On the second call I was astonished and delighted by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tidings received from the good woman. Your person, and demeanour, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arms, were described, and mention made of your resolution to cross the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,southern ridge and traverse the Solesbury Road with the utmost
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expedition.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The greater part of my inquietudes were now removed. You were able to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eat and to travel, and there was little doubt that a meeting would take
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,place between us on the next morning. Meanwhile, I determined to concur
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with those who pursued the remainder of the enemy. I followed you, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the path that you were said to have taken, and quickly joined a numerous
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,party who were searching for those who, on the last night, had attacked
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a plantation that lies near this, and destroyed the inhabitants.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I need not dwell upon our doublings and circuities. The enemy was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,traced to the house of Selby. They had entered, they had put fire on the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,floor, but were compelled to relinquish their prey. Of what number they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consisted could not be ascertained; but one, lingering behind his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fellows, was shot, at the entrance of the wood, and on the spot where
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you chanced to light upon him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Selby's house was empty, and before the fire had made any progress we
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extinguished it. The drunken wretch whom you encountered had probably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,returned from his nocturnal debauch after we had left the spot.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The flying enemy was pursued with fresh diligence. They were found, by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,various tokens, to have crossed the river, and to have ascended the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mountain. We trod closely on their heels. When we arrived at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,promontory described by you, the fatigues of the night and day rendered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me unqualified to proceed. I determined that this should be the bound of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my excursions. I was anxious to obtain an interview with you, and,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unless I paused here, should not be able to gain Inglefield's as early
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the morning as I wished. Two others concurred with me in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resolution, and prepared to return to this house, which had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deserted by its tenants till the danger was past, and which had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,selected as the place of rendezvous.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"At this moment, dejected and weary, I approached the ledge which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,severed the headland from the mountain. I marked the appearance of some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,one stretched upon the ground where you lay. No domestic animal would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wander hither and place himself upon this spot. There was something
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,likewise in the appearance of the object that bespoke it to be man; but,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,if it were man, it was incontrovertibly a savage and a foe. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,determined, therefore, to rouse you by a bullet.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My decision was perhaps absurd. I ought to have gained more certainty
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before I hazarded your destruction. Be that as it will, a moment's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lingering on your part would have probably been fatal. You started on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your feet, and fired. See the hole which your random shot made through
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my sleeve! This surely was a day destined to be signalized by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hairbreadth escapes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Your action seemed incontestably to confirm my prognostics. Every one
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hurried to the spot and was eager to destroy an enemy. No one hesitated
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to believe that some of the shots aimed at you had reached their mark,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and that you had sunk to rise no more.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The gun which was fired and thrown down was taken and examined. It had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,been my companion in many a toilsome expedition. It had rescued me and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my friends from a thousand deaths. In order to recognise it, I needed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,only to touch and handle it. I instantly discovered that I held in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hand the fusil which I had left with you on parting, with which your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,uncle had equipped himself, and which had been ravished from him by a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,savage. What was I hence to infer respecting the person of the last
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possessor?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My inquiries respecting you, of the woman whose milk and bread you had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,eaten, were minute. You entered, she said, with a hatchet and gun in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your hand. While you ate, the gun was laid upon the table. She sat near,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and the piece became the object of inquisitive attention. The stock and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,barrels were described by her in such terms as left no doubt that this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was the _fusil_.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"A comparison of incidents enabled me to trace the manner in which you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,came into possession of this instrument. One of those whom you found in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cavern was the assassin of your uncle. According to the girl's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,report, on issuing from your hiding-place you seized a gun that was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unoccupied, and this gun chanced to be your own.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Its two barrels were probably the cause of your success in that unequal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,contest at Mab's hut. On recovering from _deliquium_, you found it where
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,it had been dropped by you, out of sight and unsuspected by the party
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that had afterwards arrived. In your passage to the river, had it once
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more fallen into hostile hands? or had you missed the way, wandered to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this promontory, and mistaken a troop of friends for a band of Indian
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,marauders?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Either supposition was dreadful. The latter was the most plausible. No
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,motives were conceivable by which one of the fugitives could be induced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to post himself here, in this conspicuous station; whereas, the road
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which led you to the summit of the hill, to that spot where descent to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the river-road was practicable, could not be found but by those who were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accustomed to traverse it. The directions which you had exacted from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your hostess proved your previous unacquaintance with these tracts.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I acquiesced in this opinion with a heavy and desponding heart. Fate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had led us into a maze which could only terminate in the destruction of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,one or of the other. By the breadth of a hair had I escaped death from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your hand. The same fortune had not befriended you. After my tedious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,search, I had lighted on you, forlorn, bewildered, perishing with cold
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and hunger. Instead of recognising and affording you relief, I compelled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you to leap into the river, from a perilous height, and had desisted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from my persecution only when I had bereaved you of life and plunged you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to the bottom of the gulf.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My motives in coming to America were numerous and mixed. Among these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was the parental affection with which you had inspired me. I came with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fortune, and a better gift than fortune, in my hand. I intended to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bestow both upon you, not only to give you competence, but one who would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,endear to you that competence, who would enhance, by participating,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,every gratification.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"My schemes were now at an end. You were gone, beyond the reach of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benevolence and justice. I had robbed your two sisters of a friend and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guardian. It was some consolation to think that it was in my power to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stand, with regard to them, in your place; that I could snatch them from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the poverty, dependence, and humiliation, to which your death and that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of your uncle had reduced them.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I was now doubly weary of the enterprise in which I was engaged, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,returned with speed to this rendezvous. My companions have gone to know
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the state of the family who resided under this roof, and left me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,beguile the tedious moments in whatever manner I pleased.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I have omitted mentioning one incident that happened between the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,detection of your flight and our expedition to Chetasco. Having formed a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,plausible conjecture as to him who walked in the long room, it was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obvious to conclude that he who purloined your manuscript, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,walker, was the same personage. It was likewise easily inferred that the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,letters were secreted in the cedar chest or in some other part of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,room. Instances similar to this have heretofore occurred. Men have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,employed anxious months in search of that which, in a freak of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,noctambulation, was hidden by their own hands.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"A search was immediately commenced, and your letters were found,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,carefully concealed between the rafters and shingles of the roof, in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spot where, if suspicion had not been previously excited, they would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have remained till the vernal rains and the summer heats had insensibly
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destroyed them. This packet I carried with me, knowing the value which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you set upon it, and there being no receptacle equally safe but your own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cabinet, which was locked.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Having, as I said, reached this house, and being left alone, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bethought me of the treasure I possessed. I was unacquainted with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reasons for which these papers were so precious. They probably had some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,momentous and intimate connection with your own history. As such, they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could not be of little value to me, and this moment of inoccupation and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regrets was as suitable as any other to the task of perusing them. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,drew them forth, therefore, and laid them on the table in this chamber.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The rest is known to you. During a momentary absence you entered.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Surely no interview of ancient friends ever took place in so unexpected
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and abrupt a manner. You were dead. I mourned for you, as one whom I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,loved, and whom fate had snatched forever from my sight. Now, in a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,blissful hour, you had risen, and my happiness in thus embracing you is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tenfold greater than would have been experienced if no uncertainties and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perils had protracted our meeting."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XXVI.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Here ended the tale of Sarsefield. Humiliation and joy were mingled in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my heart. The events that preceded my awakening in the cave were now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,luminous and plain. What explication was more obvious? What but this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,solution ought to have been suggested by the conduct I had witnessed in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero? Was not this the man whom Clithero had robbed of his friend?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Was not this the lover of Mrs. Lorimer, the object of the persecutions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of Wiatte? Was it not now given me to investigate the truth of that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stupendous tale? To dissipate the doubts which obstinately clung to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imagination respecting it?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But soft! Had not Sarsefield said that he was married? Was Mrs. Lorimer
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,so speedily forgotten by him, or was the narrative of Clithero the web
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of imposture or the raving of insanity?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These new ideas banished all personal considerations from my mind. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,looked eagerly into the face of my friend, and exclaimed, in a dubious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accent, "How say you? Married? When? To whom?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Yes, Huntly, I am wedded to the most excellent of women. To her am I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indebted for happiness, and wealth, and dignity, and honour. To her do I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,owe the power of being the benefactor and protector of you and your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sisters. She longs to embrace you as a son. To become truly her son will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depend upon your own choice, and that of one who was the companion of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,our voyage."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Heavens!" cried I, in a transport of exultation and astonishment. "Of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom do you speak? Of the mother of Clarice? The sister of Wiatte? The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sister of the ruffian who laid snares for her life? Who pursued you and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the unhappy Clithero with the bitterest animosity?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My friend started at these sounds as if the earth had yawned at his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,feet. His countenance was equally significant of terror and rage. As
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,soon as he regained the power of utterance, he spoke:--"Clithero! Curses
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,light upon thy lips for having uttered that detested name! Thousands of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,miles have I flown to shun the hearing of it. Is the madman here? Have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you set eyes upon him? Does he yet crawl upon the face of the earth?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Unhappy? Unparalleled, unheard-of, thankless miscreant! Has he told his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,execrable falsehoods here? Has he dared to utter names so sacred as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,those of Euphemia Lorimer and Clarice?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"He has; he has told a tale that had all the appearances of truth----"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Out upon the villain! The truth! Truth would prove him to be unnatural,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,devilish; a thing for which no language has yet provided a name! He has
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,called himself unhappy? No doubt, a victim to injustice! Overtaken by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unmerited calamity. Say! Has he fooled thee with such tales?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"No. His tale was a catalogue of crimes and miseries of which he was the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,author and sufferer. You know not his motives, his horrors------"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"His deeds were monstrous and infernal. His motives were sordid and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flagitious. To display all their ugliness and infamy was not his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,province. No; he did not tell you that he stole at midnight to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chamber of his mistress; a woman who astonished the world by her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,loftiness and magnanimity, by indefatigable beneficence and unswerving
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,equity; who had lavished on this wretch, whom she snatched from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dirt, all the goods of fortune, all the benefits of education; all the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,treasures of love; every provocation to gratitude; every stimulant to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,justice.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"He did not tell you that, in recompense for every benefit, he stole
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon her sleep and aimed a dagger at her breast. There was no room for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flight, or ambiguity, or prevarication. She whom he meant to murder
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stood near, saw the lifted weapon, and heard him confess and glory in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his purposes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"No wonder that the shock bereft her, for a time, of life. The interval
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was seized by the ruffian to effect his escape. The rebukes of justice
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were shunned by a wretch conscious of his inexpiable guilt. These things
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he has hidden from you, and has supplied their place by a tale specious
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as false."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"No. Among the number of his crimes, hypocrisy is not to be numbered.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These things are already known to me: he spared himself too little in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the narrative. The excellencies of his lady, her claims to gratitude and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,veneration, were urged beyond their true bounds. His attempts upon her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life were related. It is true that he desired and endeavoured to destroy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"How? Has he told you this?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"He has told me all. Alas! the criminal intention has been amply
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expiated."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What mean you? Whence and how came he hither? Where is he now? I will
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not occupy the same land, the same world, with him. Have this woman and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her daughter lighted on the shore haunted by this infernal and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,implacable enemy?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Alas! It is doubtful whether he exists. If he lives, he is no longer to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be feared; but he lives not. Famine and remorse have utterly consumed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Famine? Remorse? You talk in riddles."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"He has immured himself in the desert. He has abjured the intercourse of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mankind. He has shut himself in caverns where famine must inevitably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expedite that death for which he longs as the only solace of his woes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To no imagination are his offences blacker and more odious than to his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,own. I had hopes of rescuing him from this fate, but my own infirmities
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and errors have afforded me sufficient occupation."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield renewed his imprecations on the memory of that unfortunate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,man, and his inquiries as to the circumstances that led him into this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remote district. His inquiries were not to be answered by one in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,present condition. My languors and fatigues had now gained a pitch that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was insupportable. The wound in my face had been chafed and inflamed by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the cold water and the bleak air; and the pain attending it would no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,longer suffer my attention to stray. I sunk upon the floor, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entreated him to afford me the respite of a few hours' repose.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He was sensible of the deplorableness of my condition, and chid himself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,for the negligence of which he had already been guilty. He lifted me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the bed, and deliberated on the mode he should pursue for my relief.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some mollifying application to my wound was immediately necessary; but,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in our present lonely condition, it was not at hand. It could only be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,procured from a distance. It was proper therefore to hasten to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nearest inhabited dwelling, which belonged to one by name Walton, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,supply himself with such medicines as could be found.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Meanwhile, there was no danger of molestation and intrusion. There was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reason to expect the speedy return of those who had gone in pursuit of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the savages. This was their place of rendezvous, and hither they
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appointed to reassemble before the morrow's dawn. The distance of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,neighbouring farm was small, and Sarsefield promised to be expeditious.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He left me to myself and my own ruminations.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Harassed by fatigue and pain, I had yet power to ruminate on that series
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of unparalleled events that had lately happened. I wept, but my tears
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,flowed from a double source: from sorrow, on account of the untimely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fate of my uncle, and from joy, that my sisters were preserved, that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield had returned and was not unhappy.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I reflected on the untoward destiny of Clithero. Part of his calamity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consisted in the consciousness of having killed his patroness; but it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now appeared, though by some infatuation I had not previously suspected,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that the first impulse of sorrow in the lady had been weakened by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reflection and by time; that the prejudice persuading her that her life
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and that of her brother were to endure and to terminate together was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conquered by experience or by argument. She had come, in company with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield and Clarice, to America. What influence might these events
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have upon the gloomy meditations of Clithero? Was it possible to bring
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them together; to win the maniac from his solitude, wrest from him his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fatal purposes, and restore him to communion with the beings whose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imagined indignation is the torment of his life?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These musings were interrupted by a sound from below, which was easily
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interpreted into tokens of the return of those with whom Sarsefield had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,parted at the promontory. Voices were confused and busy, but not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,turbulent. They entered the lower room, and the motion of chairs and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tables showed that they were preparing to rest themselves after their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,toils.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Few of them were unacquainted with me, since they probably were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,residents in this district. No inconvenience, therefore, would follow
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from an interview, though, on their part, wholly unexpected. Besides,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield would speedily return, and none of the present visitants
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would be likely to withdraw to this apartment.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Meanwhile, I lay upon the bed, with my face turned towards the door, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,languidly gazing at the ceiling and Walls. Just then a musket was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discharged in the room below. The shock affected me mechanically, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the first impulse of surprise made me almost start upon my feet.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The sound was followed by confusion and bustle. Some rushed forth and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,called on each other to run different ways, and the words, "That is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,he,"--"Stop him!" were spoken in a tone of eagerness and rage. My
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,weakness and pain were for a moment forgotten, and my whole attention
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was bent to discover the meaning of this hubbub. The musket which I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brought with me to this chamber lay across the bed. Unknowing of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequences of this affray with regard to myself, I was prompted, by a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kind of self-preserving instinct, to lay hold of the gun and prepare to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repel any attack that might be made upon me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A few moments elapsed, when I thought I heard light footsteps in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entry leading to this room. I had no time to construe these signals,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but, watching fearfully the entrance, I grasped my weapon with new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,force, and raised it so as to be ready at the moment of my danger. I did
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not watch long. A figure cautiously thrust itself forward. The first
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,glance was sufficient to inform me that this intruder was an Indian,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, of consequence, an enemy. He was unarmed. Looking eagerly on all
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sides, he at last spied me as I lay. My appearance threw him into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consternation, and, after the fluctuation of an instant, he darted to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the window, threw up the sash, and leaped out upon the ground.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His flight might have been easily arrested by my shot, but surprise,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,added to my habitual antipathy to bloodshed unless in cases of absolute
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,necessity, made me hesitate. He was gone, and I was left to mark the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,progress of the drama. The silence was presently broken by firing at a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,distance. Three shots, in quick succession, were followed by the deepest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pause.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,That the party, recently arrived, had brought with them one or more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,captives, and that by some sudden effort the prisoners had attempted to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,escape, was the only supposition that I could form. By wrhat motives
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,either of them could be induced to seek concealment in my chamber could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not be imagined.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now heard a single step on the threshold below. Some one entered the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,common room. He traversed the floor during a few minutes, and then,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ascending the staircase, he entered my chamber. It was Sarsefield.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Trouble and dismay were strongly written on his countenance. He seemed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,totally unconscious of my presence; his eyes were fixed upon the floor,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, as he continued to move across the room, he heaved forth deep
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sighs.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This deportment was mournful and mysterious. It was little in unison
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with those appearances which he wore at our parting, and must have been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggested by some event that had since happened. My curiosity impelled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me to recall him from his reverie. I rose, and, seizing him by the arm,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,looked at him with an air of inquisitive anxiety. It was needless to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,speak.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He noticed my movement, and, turning towards me, spoke in a tone of some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,resentment:--"Why did you deceive me? Did you not say Clithero was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dead?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I said so because it was my belief. Know you any thing to the contrary?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Heaven grant that he is still alive, and that our mutual efforts may
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,restore him to peace!"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Heaven grant," replied my friend, with a vehemence that bordered upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fury,--"Heaven grant that he may live thousands of years, and know not,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in their long course, a moment's respite from remorse and from anguish!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But this prayer is fruitless. He is not dead, but death hovers over him.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Should he live, he will live only to defy justice and perpetrate new
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,horrors. My skill might perhaps save him, but a finger shall not be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moved to avert his fate.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Little did I think that the wretch whom my friends rescued from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,power of the savages, and brought wounded and expiring hither, was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero. They sent for me in haste to afford him surgical assistance. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,found him stretched upon the floor below, deserted, helpless, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bleeding. The moment I beheld him, he was recognised. The last of evils
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was to look upon the face of this assassin; but that evil is past, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,shall never be endured again.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Rise, and come with me. Accommodation is prepared for you at Walcot's.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Let us leave this house, and, the moment you are able to perform a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,journey, abandon forever this district."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I could not readily consent to this proposal. Clithero had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,delivered from captivity, but was dying for want of that aid which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield was able to afford. Was it not inhuman to desert him in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,extremity? What offence had he committed that deserved such implacable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vengeance? Nothing I had heard from Sarsefield was in contradiction to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his own story. His deed, imperfectly observed, would appear to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,atrocious and detestable; but the view of all its antecedent and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accompanying events and motives would surely place it in the list, not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of crimes, but of misfortunes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But wrhat is that guilt which no penitence can expiate? Had not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero's remorse been more than adequate to crimes far more deadly and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,enormous than this? This, however, was no time to argue with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passions of Sarsefield. Nothing but a repetition of Clithero's tale
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could vanquish his prepossessions and mollify his rage; but this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repetition was impossible to be given by me, till a moment of safety and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,composure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These thoughts made me linger, but hindered me from attempting to change
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the determination of my friend. He renewed his importunities for me to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fly with him. He dragged me by the arm, and, wavering and reluctant, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,followed where he chose to lead. He crossed the common room, with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hurried steps, and eyes averted from a figure which instantly fastened
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my attention.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was indeed Clithero whom I now beheld, supine, polluted with blood,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his eyes closed, and apparently insensible. This object was gazed at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with emotions that rooted me to the spot. Sarsefield, perceiving me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,determined to remain where I was, rushed out of the house, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappeared.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Chapter XXVII.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I hung over the unhappy wretch, whose emaciated form and rueful features
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufficiently bespoke that savage hands had only completed that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destruction which his miseries had begun. He was mangled by the tomahawk
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in a shocking manner, and there was little hope that human skill could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,save his life.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was sensible of nothing but compassion. I acted without design, when,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,seating myself on the floor, I raised his head and placed it on my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,knees. This movement awakened his attention, and, opening his eyes, he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fixed them on my countenance. They testified neither insensibility, nor
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,horror, nor distraction. A faint emotion of surprise gave way to an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appearance of tranquillity. Having perceived these tokens of a state
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,less hopeless than I at first imagined, I spoke to him:--"My friend, how
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,do you feel? Can any thing be done for you?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He answered me in a tone more firm and with more coherence of ideas
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,than previous appearances had taught me to expect. "No," said he; "thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kindness, good youth, can avail me nothing. The end of my existence here
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,is at hand. May my guilt be expiated by the miseries that I have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suffered, and my good deeds only attend me to the presence of my divine
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Judge!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I am waiting, not with trembling or dismay, for this close of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sorrows. I breathed but one prayer, and that prayer has been answered. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,asked for an interview with thee, young man; but, feeling as I now feel,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this interview, so much desired, was beyond my hope. Now thou art come,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in due season, to hear the last words that I shall need to utter.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I wanted to assure thee that thy efforts for my benefit were not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,useless. They have saved me from murdering myself, a guilt more
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inexpiable than any which it was in my power to commit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I retired to the innermost recess of Norwalk, and gained the summit of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a hill, by subterranean paths. This hill I knew to be on all sides
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inaccessible to human footsteps, and the subterranean passages were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,closed up by stones. Here I believed my solitude exempt from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interruption, and my death, in consequence of famine, sure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This persuasion was not taken away by your appearance on the opposite
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,steep. The chasm which severed us I knew to be impassable. I withdrew
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from your sight.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Some time after, awakening from a long sleep, I found victuals beside
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me. He that brought it was invisible. For a time, I doubted whether some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,messenger of heaven had not interposed for my salvation. How other than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by supernatural means my retreat should be explored, I was unable to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conceive. The summit was encompassed by dizzy and profound gulfs, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the subterranean passages were still closed.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This opinion, though corrected by subsequent reflection, tended to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,change the course of my desperate thoughts. My hunger, thus
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,importunately urged, would not abstain, and I ate of the food that was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,provided. Henceforth I determined to live, to resume the path of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,obscurity and labour which I had relinquished, and wait till my God
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,should summon me to retribution. To anticipate his call is only to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,redouble our guilt.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I designed not to return to Inglefield's service, but to choose some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,other and remoter district. Meanwhile, I had left in his possession a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,treasure, which my determination to die had rendered of no value, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which my change of resolution restored. Enclosed in a box at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Inglefield's were the memoirs of Euphemia Lorimer, by which, in all my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vicissitudes, I had been hitherto accompanied, and from which I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consented to part only because I had refused to live. My existence was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now to be prolonged, and this manuscript was once more to constitute the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,torment and the solace of my being.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I hastened to Inglefield's by night. There was no need to warn him of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my purpose. I desired that my fate should be an eternal secret to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ancient master and his neighbours. The apartment containing my box was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,well known, and easily accessible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The box was found, but broken and rifled of its treasure. My transports
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of astonishment, and indignation, and grief, yielded to the resumption
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my fatal purpose. I hastened back to the hill, and determined anew to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perish.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This mood continued to the evening of the ensuing day. Wandering over
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rocks and pits, I discovered the manuscript lying under a jutting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precipice. The chance that brought it hither was not less propitious and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,miraculous than that by which I had been supplied with food. It produced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a similar effect upon my feelings, and, while in possession of this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,manuscript, I was reconciled to the means of life. I left the mountain,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, traversing the wilderness, stopped in Chetasco. That kind of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,employment which I sought was instantly procured; but my new vocation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was scarcely assumed when a band of savages invaded our security.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Rambling in the desert by moonlight, I encountered these foes. They
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rushed upon me, and, after numerous wounds, which for the present
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,neither killed nor disabled me, they compelled me to keep pace with them
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in their retreat. Some hours have passed since the troop was overtaken
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and my liberty redeemed. Hardships, and repeated wounds, inflicted at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the moment when the invaders were surprised and slain, have brought me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to my present condition. I rejoice that my course is about to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,terminate."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Here the speaker was interrupted by the tumultuous entrance of the party
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by whom he had been brought hither. Their astonishment at seeing me
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sustaining the head of the dying man may be easily conceived. Their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surprise was more strongly excited by the disappearance of the captive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whom they had left in this apartment, bound hand and foot. It now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,appeared that, of the savage troop who had adventured thus far in search
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of pillage and blood, all had been destroyed but two, who had been led
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hither as prisoners. On their entrance into this house, one of the party
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been sent to Walcot's to summon Sarsefield to the aid of the wounded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,man, while others had gone in search of cords to secure the arms and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,legs of the captives, who had hitherto been manacled imperfectly.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The cords were brought and one of them was bound; but the other, before
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the same operation was begun upon him, broke, by a sudden effort, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,feeble ligatures by which he was at present constrained, and, seizing a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,musket that lay near him, fired on his enemies, and then rushed out of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,doors. All eagerly engaged in the pursuit. The savage was fleet as a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deer, and finally eluded his pursuers.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,While their attention was thus engaged abroad, he that remained found
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means to extricate his wrists and ankles from his bonds, and, betaking
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,himself to the stairs, escaped, as I before described, through the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,window of the room which I had occupied. They pestered me with their
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,curiosity and wonder, for I was known to all of them; but, waiving the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,discussion of my own concerns, I entreated their assistance to carry
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero to the chamber and the bed which I had just deserted.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I now, in spite of pain, fatigue, and watchfulness, set out to go to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Walton's. Sarsefield was ready to receive me at the door, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,kindness and compassion of the family were active in my behalf. I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conducted to a chamber and provided with suitable attendance and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remedies.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was not unmindful of the more deplorable condition of Clithero. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incessantly meditated on the means for his relief. His case stood in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,need of all the vigilance and skill of a physician, and Sarsefield was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the only one of that profession whose aid could be seasonably
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,administered. Sarsefield, therefore, must be persuaded to bestow this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,aid.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,There was but one mode of conquering his abhorrence of this man,--to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,prepossess my friend with the belief of the innocence of Clithero, or to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,soothe him into pity by a picture of remorse and suffering. This could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be done, and in the manner most conformable to truth, by a simple
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,recital of the incidents that had befallen, and by repeating the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,confession which had been extorted from Clithero.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I requested all but my friend to leave my chamber, and then, soliciting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a patient hearing, began the narrative of Waldegrave's death; of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,detection of Clithero beneath the shade of the elm; of the suspicions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which were thence produced; and of the forest interview to which these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspicions gave birth. I then repeated, without variation or addition,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the tale which was then told. I likewise mentioned my subsequent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,transactions in Norwalk, so far as they illustrated the destiny of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,During this recital, I fixed my eyes upon the countenance of Sarsefield,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and watched every emotion as it arose or declined. With the progress of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my tale, his indignation and his fury grew less, and at length gave
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,place to horror and compassion.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His seat became uneasy; his pulse throbbed with new vehemence. When I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,came to the motives which prompted the unhappy man to visit the chamber
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his mistress, he started from his seat, and sometimes strode across
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the floor in a troubled mood, and sometimes stood before me, with his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,breath almost suspended in the eagerness of his attention. When I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mentioned the lifted dagger, the shriek from behind, and the apparition
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that interposed, he shuddered and drew back, as if a dagger had been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,aimed at his breast.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,When the tale was done, some time elapsed in mutual and profound
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,silence. My friend's thoughts were involved in a mournful and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,indefinable reverie. From this he at length recovered and spoke:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"It is true. A tale like this could never be the fruit of invention, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be invented to deceive. He has done himself injustice. His character was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,spotless and fair. All his moral properties seemed to have resolved
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,themselves into gratitude, fidelity, and honour.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"We parted at the door, late in the evening, as he mentioned, and he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guessed truly that subsequent reflection had induced me to return and to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disclose the truth to Mrs. Lorimer. Clarice, relieved by the sudden
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,death of her friend, and unexpectedly by all, arrived at the same hour.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"These tidings astonished, afflicted, and delighted the lady. Her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,brother's death had been long believed by all but herself. To find her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,doubts verified, and his existence ascertained, was the dearest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consolation that he ever could bestow. She was afflicted at the proofs
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that had been noted of the continuance of his depravity, but she dreaded
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no danger to herself from his malignity or vengeance.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"The ignorance and prepossessions of this woman were remarkable. On this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subject only she was perverse, headstrong, obstinate. Her anxiety to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benefit this archruffian occupied her whole thoughts, and allowed her no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time to reflect upon the reasonings or remonstrances of others. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,could not be prevailed on to deny herself to his visits, and I parted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from her in the utmost perplexity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"A messenger came to me at midnight, entreating my immediate presence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some disaster had happened, but of what kind the messenger was unable to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tell. My fears easily conjured up the image of Wiatte. Terror scarcely
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,allowed me to breathe. When I entered the house of Mrs. Lorimer, I was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conducted to her chamber. She lay upon the bed in a state of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,stupefaction, that arose from some mental cause. Clarice sat by her,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wringing her hands, and pouring forth her tears without intermission.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Neither could explain to me the nature of the scene. I made inquiries of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the servants and attendants. They merely said that the family as usual
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had retired to rest, but their lady's bell rung with great violence, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,called them in haste to her chamber, where they found her in a swoon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,upon the floor, and the young lady in the utmost affright and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perturbation.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Suitable means being used, Mrs. Lorimer had, at length, recovered, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was still nearly insensible. I went to Clithero's apartments; but he was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not to be found, and the domestics informed me that, since he had gone
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,with me, he had not returned. The doors between this chamber and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,court were open; hence, that some dreadful interview had taken place,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perhaps with Wiatte, was an unavoidable conjecture. He had withdrawn,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,however, without committing any personal injury.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I need not mention my reflections upon this scene. All was tormenting
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,doubt and suspense, till the morning arrived, and tidings were received
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that Wiatte had been killed in the streets. This event was antecedent to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that which had occasioned Mrs. Lorimer's distress and alarm. I now
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,remembered that fatal prepossession by which the lady was governed, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her frantic belief that her death and that of her brother were to fall
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,out at the same time. Could some witness of his death have brought her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tidings of it? Had he penetrated, unexpected and unlicensed, to her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,chamber? and were these the effects produced by the intelligence?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Presently I knew that not only Wiatte was dead, but that Clithero had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,killed him. Clithero had not been known to return, and was nowhere to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,found. He, then, was the bearer of these tidings, for none but he could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have found access or egress without disturbing the servants.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"These doubts were at length at an end. In a broken and confused manner,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and after the lapse of some days, the monstrous and portentous truth was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disclosed. After our interview, the lady and her daughter had retired to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the same chamber; the former had withdrawn to her closet, and the latter
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to bed. Some one's entrance alarmed the lady, and, coming forth after a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,moment's pause, the spectacle which Clithero has too faithfully
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,described presented itself.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What could I think? A life of uniform hypocrisy, or a sudden loss of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reason, were the only suppositions to be formed. Clithero was the parent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of fury and abhorrence in my heart. In either case I started at the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,name. I shuddered at the image of the apostate or the maniac.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"What? Kill the brother whose existence was interwoven with that of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benefactress and his friend? Then hasten to her chamber, and attempt her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,life? Lift a dagger to destroy her who had been the author of his being
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and his happiness?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"He that could meditate a deed like this was no longer man. An agent
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from hell had mastered his faculties. He was become the engine of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,infernal malice, against whom it was the duty of all mankind to rise up
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in arms and never to desist till, by shattering it to atoms, its power
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to injure was taken away.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"All inquiries to discover the place of his retreat were vain. No
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wonder, methought, that he wrapped himself in the folds of impenetrable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,secrecy. Curbed, checked, baffled in the midst of his career, no wonder
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that he shrunk into obscurity, that he fled from justice and revenge,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that he dared not meet the rebukes of that eye which, dissolving in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tenderness or flashing with disdain, had ever been irresistible.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"But how shall I describe the lady's condition? Clithero she had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cherished from his infancy. He was the stay, the consolation, the pride
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her life. His projected alliance with her daughter made him still
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more dear. Her eloquence was never tired of expatiating on his purity
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and rectitude. No wonder that she delighted in this theme, for he was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her own work. His virtues were the creatures of her bounty.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"How hard to be endured was this sad reverse! She can be tranquil, but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,never more will she be happy. To promote her forgetfulness of him, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,persuaded her to leave her country, which contained a thousand memorials
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of past calamity, and which was lapsing fast into civil broils. Clarice
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,has accompanied us, and time may effect the happiness of others by her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means, though she can never remove the melancholy of her mother.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I have listened to your tale, not without compassion. What would you
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have me to do? To prolong his life would be merely to protract his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,misery.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"He can never be regarded with complacency by my wife. He can never be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,thought of without shuddering by Clarice. Common ills are not without a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cure less than death, but here all remedies are vain. Consciousness
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,itself is the malady, the pest, of which he only is cured who ceases to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,think."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I could not but assent to this mournful conclusion: yet, though death
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was better to Clithero than life, could not some of his mistakes be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rectified? Euphemia Lorimer, contrary to his belief, was still alive. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,dreamed that she was dead, and a thousand evils were imagined to flow
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from that death. This death, and its progeny of ills, haunted his fancy,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and added keenness to his remorse. Was it not our duty to rectify this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,error?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield reluctantly assented to the truth of my arguments on this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,head. He consented to return, and afford the dying man the consolation
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of knowing that the being whom he adored as a benefactor and parent had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,not been deprived of existence, though bereft of peace by his act.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,During Sarsefield's absence my mind was busy in revolving the incidents
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that had just occurred. I ruminated on the last words of Clithero. There
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was somewhat in his narrative that was obscure and contradictory. He had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,left the manuscript, which he so much and so justly prized, in his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cabinet. He entered the chamber in my absence, and found the cabinet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unfastened and the manuscript gone. It was I by whom the cabinet was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,opened; but the manuscript supposed to be contained in it was buried in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the earth beneath the elm. How should Clithero be unacquainted with its
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,situation, since none but Clithero could have dug for it this grave?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This mystery vanished when I reflected on the history of my own
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,manuscript. Clithero had buried his treasure with his own hands, as mine
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had been secreted by myself; but both acts had been performed during
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sleep. The deed was neither prompted by the will nor noticed by the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,senses of him by whom it was done. Disastrous and humiliating is the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,state of man! By his own hands is constructed the mass of misery and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,error in which his steps are forever involved.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus it was with thy friend. Hurried on by phantoms too indistinct to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,now recalled, I wandered from my chamber to the desert. I plunged into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some unvisited cavern, and easily proceeded till I reached the edge of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pit. There my step was deceived, and I tumbled headlong from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,precipice. The fall bereaved me of sense, and I continued breathless and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,motionless during the remainder of the night and the ensuing day.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,How little cognizance have men over the actions and motives of each
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,other! How total is our blindness with regard to our own performances!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Who would have sought me in the bowels of this mountain? Ages might have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,passed away, before my bones would be discovered in this tomb by some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,traveller whom curiosity had prompted to explore it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was roused from these reflections by Sarsefield's return. Inquiring
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,into Clithero's condition, he answered that the unhappy man was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,insensible, but that, notwithstanding numerous and dreadful gashes in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,different parts of his body, it was possible that, by submitting to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,necessary treatment, he might recover.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Encouraged by this information, I endeavoured to awaken the zeal and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compassion of my friend in Clithero's behalf. He recoiled with
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,involuntary shuddering from any task which would confine him to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,presence of this man. Time and reflection, he said, might introduce
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,different sentiments and feelings, but at present he could not but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,regard this person as a maniac, whose disease was irremediable, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whose existence could not be protracted but to his own misery and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,misery of others.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Finding him irreconcilably averse to any scheme connected with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,welfare of Clithero, I began to think that his assistance as a surgeon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was by no means necessary. He had declared that the sufferer needed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing more than common treatment; and to this the skill of a score of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,aged women in this district, furnished with simples culled from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forest, and pointed out, of old time, by Indian _leeches_, was no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,less adequate than that of Sarsefield. These women were ready and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,officious in their charity, and none of them were prepossessed against
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the sufferer by a knowledge of his genuine story.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield, meanwhile, was impatient for my removal to Inglefield's
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,habitation, and that venerable friend was no less impatient to receive
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me. My hurts were superficial, and my strength sufficiently repaired by
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a night's repose. Next day I went thither, leaving Clithero to the care
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his immediate neighbours.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield's engagements compelled him to prosecute his journey into
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Virginia, from which he had somewhat deviated in order to visit
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Solesbury. He proposed to return in less than a month, and then to take
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,me in his company to New York. He has treated me with paternal
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tenderness, and insists upon the privilege of consulting for my interest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,as if he were my real father. Meanwhile these views have been disclosed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to Inglefield, and it is with him that I am to remain, with my sisters,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,until his return.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My reflections have been various and tumultuous. They have been busy in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,relation to you, to Weymouth, and especially to Clithero. The latter,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,polluted with gore and weakened by abstinence, fatigue, and the loss of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,blood, appeared in my eyes to be in a much more dangerous condition than
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the event proved him to be. I was punctually informed of the progress of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his cure, and proposed in a few days to visit him. The duty of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,explaining the truth, respecting the present condition of Mrs. Lorimer,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had devolved upon me. By imparting this intelligence, I hoped to work
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the most auspicious revolutions in his feelings, and prepared,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,therefore, with alacrity, for an interview.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In this hope I was destined to be disappointed. On the morning on which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I intended to visit him, a messenger arrived from the house in which he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was entertained, and informed us that the family, on entering the sick
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,man's apartment, had found it deserted. It appeared that Clithero had,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,during the night, risen from his bed and gone secretly forth. No traces
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his flight have since been discovered.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,But, oh, my friend, the death of Waldegrave, thy brother, is at length
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,divested of uncertainty and mystery. Hitherto, I had been able to form
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no conjecture respecting it; but the solution was found shortly after
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this time.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Queen Mab, three days after my adventure, was seized in her hut on
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suspicion of having aided and counselled her countrymen in their late
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depredations. She was not to be awed or intimidated by the treatment she
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,received, but readily confessed and gloried in the mischief she had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,done, and accounted for it by enumerating the injuries which she had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,received from her neighbours.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These injuries consisted in contemptuous or neglectful treatment, and in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the rejection of groundless and absurd claims. The people of Chetasco
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,were less obsequious to her humours than those of Solesbury, her ancient
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,neighbourhood, and her imagination brooded for a long time over nothing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but schemes of revenge. She became sullen, irascible, and spent more of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her time in solitude than ever.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,A troop of her countrymen at length visited her hut. Their intentions
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,being hostile, they concealed from the inhabitants their presence in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,this quarter of the country. Some motives induced them to withdraw and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,postpone, for the present, the violence which they meditated. One of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,them, however, more sanguinary and audacious than the rest, would not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,depart without some gratification of his vengeance. He left his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,associates and penetrated by night into Solesbury, resolving to attack
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the first human being whom he should meet. It was the fate of thy
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unhappy brother to encounter this ruffian, whose sagacity made him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forbear to tear away the usual trophy from the dead, lest he should
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,afford grounds for suspicion as to the authors of the evil.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Satisfied with this exploit, he rejoined his companions, and, after an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,interval of three weeks, returned with a more numerous party, to execute
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a more extensive project of destruction. They were counselled and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,guided, in all their movements, by Queen Mab, who now explained these
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,particulars and boldly defied her oppressors. Her usual obstinacy and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,infatuation induced her to remain in her ancient dwelling and prepare to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,meet the consequences.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This disclosure awakened anew all the regrets and anguish which flowed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,from that disaster. It has been productive, however, of some benefit.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Suspicions and doubts, by which my soul was harassed, and which were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,injurious to the innocent, are now at an end. It is likewise some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imperfect consolation to reflect that the assassin has himself been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,killed, and probably by my own hand. The shedder of blood no longer
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,lives to pursue his vocation, and justice is satisfied.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Thus have I fulfilled my promise to compose a minute relation of my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sufferings. I remembered my duty to thee, and, as soon as I was able to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hold a pen, employed it to inform thee of my welfare. I could not at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that time enter into particulars, but reserved a more copious narrative
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,till a period of more health and leisure.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,On looking back, I am surprised at the length to which my story has run.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I thought that a few days would suffice to complete it; but one page has
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,insensibly been added to another, till I have consumed weeks and filled
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,volumes. Here I will draw to a close; I will send you what I have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,written, and discuss with you in conversation my other immediate
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,concerns, and my schemes for the future. As soon as I have seen
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Sarsefield, I will visit you. FAREWELL. E. H.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I came hither but ten minutes ago, and write this letter in the bar of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the stage-house. I wish not to lose a moment in informing you of what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,has happened. I cannot do justice to my own feelings when I reflect upon
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the rashness of which I have been guilty.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I will give you the particulars to-morrow. At present, I shall only say
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that Clithero is alive, is apprized of your wife's arrival and abode in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,New York, and has set out with mysterious intentions to visit her.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,May Heaven avert the consequences of such a design! May you be enabled,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,by some means, to prevent their meeting! If you cannot prevent it--but I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,must not reason on such an event, nor lengthen out this letter.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I will now relate the particulars which I yesterday promised to send
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you. You heard through your niece of my arrival at Inglefield's, in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Solesbury: my inquiries, you may readily suppose, would turn upon the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,fate of my friend's servant Clithero, whose last disappearance was so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,strange and abrupt, and of whom, since that time, I had heard nothing.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You are indifferent to his fate, and are anxious only that his existence
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and misfortunes may be speedily forgotten. I confess that it is somewhat
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,otherwise with me. I pity him; I wish to relieve him, and cannot admit
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the belief that his misery is without a cure. I want to find him out. I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,want to know his condition, and, if possible, to afford him comfort and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inspire him with courage and hope.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Inglefield replied to my questions:--"Oh yes! He has appeared. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,strange being is again upon the stage. Shortly after he left his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,sick-bed, I heard from Philip Beddington, of Chetasco, that Deb's hut had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,found a new tenant. At first I imagined that the Scotsman who built it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,had returned; but, making closer inquiries, I found that the new tenant
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was my servant. I had no inclination to visit him myself, but frequently
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,inquired respecting him of those who lived or passed that way, and find
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,that he still lives there."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"But how!" said I: "what is his mode of subsistence? The winter has been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no time for cultivation; and he found, I presume, nothing in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ground."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Deb's hut," replied my friend, "is his lodging and his place of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,retirement, but food and clothing he procures by labouring on a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,neighbouring farm. This farm is next to that of Beddington, who
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,consequently knows something of his present situation. I find little or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,no difference in his present deportment and those appearances which he
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,assumed while living with me, except that he retires every night to his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hut, and holds as little intercourse as possible with the rest of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,mankind. He dines at his employer's table; but his supper, which is
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,nothing but rye-bread, he carries home with him, and, at all those times
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,when disengaged from employment, he secludes himself in his hut, or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,wanders nobody knows whither."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This was the substance of Inglefield's intelligence. I gleaned from it
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,some satisfaction. It proved the condition of Clithero to be less
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deplorable and desperate than I had previously imagined. His fatal and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,gloomy thoughts seemed to have somewhat yielded to tranquillity.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,In the course of my reflections, however, I could not but perceive that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his condition, though eligible when compared with what it once was, was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,likewise disastrous and humiliating, compared with his youthful hopes
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and his actual merits. For such a one to mope away his life in this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,unsocial and savage state was deeply to be deplored. It was my duty, if
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible, to prevail on him to relinquish his scheme. And what would be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,requisite, for that end, but to inform him of the truth?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The source of his dejection was the groundless belief that he had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,occasioned the death of his benefactress. It was this alone that could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,justly produce remorse or grief. It was a distempered imagination both
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in him and in me that had given birth to this opinion, since the terms
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of his narrative, impartially considered, were far from implying that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,catastrophe. To him, however, the evidence which he possessed was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,incontestable. No deductions from probability could overthrow his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,belief. This could only be effected by similar and counter evidence. To
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,apprize him that she was now alive, in possession of some degree of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,happiness, the wife of Sarsefield, and an actual resident on this shore,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,would dissipate the sanguinary apparition that haunted him, cure his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,diseased intellects, and restore him to those vocations for which his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,talents, and that rank in society for which his education, had qualified
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him. Influenced by these thoughts, I determined to visit his retreat.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Being obliged to leave Solesbury the next day, I resolved to set out the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,same afternoon, and, stopping in Chetasco for the night, seek his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,habitation at the hour when he had probably retired to it.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This was done. I arrived at Beddington's at nightfall. My inquiries
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,respecting Clithero obtained for me the same intelligence from him which
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had received from Inglefield. Deb's hut was three miles from this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,habitation, and thither, when the evening had somewhat advanced, I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,repaired. This was the spot which had witnessed so many perils during
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the last year; and my emotions, on approaching it, were awful. With
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,palpitating heart and quick steps I traversed the road, skirted on each
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,side by thickets, and the area before the house. The dwelling was by no
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,means in so ruinous a state as when I last visited it. The crannies
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,between the logs had been filled up, and the light within was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,perceivable only at a crevice in the door.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Looking through this crevice, I perceived a fire in the chimney, but the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,object of my visit was nowhere to be seen. I knocked and requested
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,admission, but no answer was made. At length I lifted the latch and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entered. Nobody was there.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,It was obvious to suppose that Clithero had gone abroad for a short
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,time, and would speedily return; or perhaps some engagement had detained
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him at his labour later than usual. I therefore seated myself on some
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,straw near the fire, which, with a woollen rug, appeared to constitute
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his only bed. The rude bedstead which I formerly met was gone. The
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,slender furniture, likewise, which had then engaged my attention, had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,disappeared. There was nothing capable of human use but a heap of fagots
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in the corner, which seemed intended for fuel. How slender is the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accommodation which nature has provided for man, and how scanty is the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,portion which our physical necessities require!
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,While ruminating upon this scene, and comparing past events with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,objects before me, the dull whistling of the gale without gave place to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the sound of footsteps. Presently the door opened, and Clithero entered
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the apartment. His aspect and guise were not essentially different from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,those which he wore when an inhabitant of Solesbury.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,To find his hearth occupied by another appeared to create the deepest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,surprise. He looked at me without any tokens of remembrance. His
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,features assumed a more austere expression, and, after scowling on my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,person for a moment, he withdrew his eyes, and, placing in a corner a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,bundle which he bore in his hand, he turned and seemed preparing to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,withdraw.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I was anxiously attentive to his demeanour, and, as soon as I perceived
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,his purpose to depart, leaped on my feet to prevent it. I took his hand,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and, affectionately pressing it, said, "Do you not know me? Have you so
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,soon forgotten me, who is truly your friend?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He looked at me with some attention, but again withdrew his eyes, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,placed himself in silence on the seat which I had left. I seated myself
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,near him, and a pause of mutual silence ensued.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My mind was full of the purpose that brought me hither, but I knew not
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in what manner to communicate my purpose. Several times I opened my lips
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to speak, but my perplexity continued, and suitable words refused to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suggest themselves. At length I said, in a confused tone,--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I came hither with a view to benefit a man with whose misfortunes his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,own lips have made me acquainted, and who has awakened in my breast the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,deepest sympathy. I know the cause and extent of his dejection. I know
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,the event which has given birth to horror and remorse in his heart. He
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,believes that, by his means, his patroness and benefactress has found an
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,untimely death."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These words produced a visible shock in my companion, which evinced that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I had at least engaged his attention. I proceeded:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"This unhappy lady was cursed with a wicked and unnatural brother. She
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,conceived a disproportionate affection for this brother, and erroneously
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imagined that her fate was blended with his, that their lives would
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,necessarily terminate at the same period, and that, therefore, whoever
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was the contriver of his death was likewise, by a fatal and invincible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,necessity, the author of her own.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"Clithero was her servant, but was raised by her bounty to the station
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of her son and the rank of her friend. Clithero, in self-defence, took
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,away the life of that unnatural brother, and, in that deed, falsely but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,cogently believed that he had perpetrated the destruction of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,benefactress.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"To ascertain the truth, he sought her presence. She was found, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tidings of her brother's death were communicated, and she sank
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,breathless at his feet."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,At these words Clithero started from the ground, and cast upon me looks
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of furious indignation. "And come you hither," he muttered, "for this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,end?--to recount my offences and drive me again to despair?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"No," answered I, with quickness; "I come to outroot a fatal but
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,powerful illusion. I come to assure you that the woman with whose
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,destruction you charge yourself is _not dead_."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These words, uttered with the most emphatical solemnity, merely produced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,looks in which contempt was mingled with anger. He continued silent.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I perceive," resumed I, "that my words are disregarded. Would to Heaven
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I were able to conquer your incredulity, could show you not only the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,truth but the probability of my tale! Can you not confide in me? that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Euphemia Lorimer is now alive, is happy, is the wife of Sarsefield? that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her brother is forgotten and his murderer regarded without enmity or
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vengeance?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,He looked at me with a strange expression of contempt. "Come," said he,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,at length; "make out thy assertion to be true. Fall on thy knees, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,invoke the thunder of Heaven to light on thy head if thy words be false.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Swear that Euphemia Lorimer is alive; happy; forgetful of Wiatte and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compassionate of me. Swear that thou hast seen her; talked with her;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,received from her own lips the confession of her pity for him who aimed
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a dagger at her bosom. Swear that she is Sarsefield's wife."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I put my hands together, and, lifting my eyes to heaven, exclaimed, "I
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,comply with your conditions. I call the omniscient God to witness that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Euphemia Lorimer is alive; that I have seen her with these eyes; have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,talked with her; have inhabited the same house for months."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These asseverations were listened to with shuddering. He laid not aside,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,however, an air of incredulity and contempt. "Perhaps," said he, "thou
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,canst point out the place of her abode?--canst guide me to the city, the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,street, the very door of her habitation?"
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I can. She resides at this moment in the city of New York; in Broadway;
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,in a house contiguous to the--."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"'Tis well!" exclaimed my companion, in a tone loud, abrupt, and in the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,utmost degree vehement. "'Tis well! Rash and infatuated youth, thou hast
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ratified, beyond appeal or forgiveness, thy own doom. Thou hast once
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,more let loose my steps, and sent me on a fearful journey. Thou hast
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,furnished the means of detecting thy imposture. I will fly to the spot
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,which thou describest. I will ascertain thy falsehood with my own eyes.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,If she be alive, then am I reserved for the performance of a new crime.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My evil destiny will have it so. If she be dead, I shall make thee
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,expiate."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,So saying, he darted through the door, and was gone in a moment beyond
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,my sight and my reach. I ran to the road, looked on every side, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,called; but my calls were repeated in vain. He had fled with the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,swiftness of a deer.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,My own embarrassment, confusion, and terror were inexpressible. His last
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,words were incoherent. They denoted the tumult and vehemence of frenzy.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,They intimated his resolution to seek the presence of your wife. I had
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,furnished a clue which could not fail to conduct him to her presence.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,What might not be dreaded from the interview? Clithero is a maniac. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,truth cannot be concealed. Your wife can with difficulty preserve her
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tranquillity when his image occurs to her remembrance. What must it be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,when he starts up before her in his neglected and ferocious guise, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,armed with purposes perhaps as terrible as those which had formerly led
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,him to her secret chamber and her bedside?
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,His meaning was obscurely conveyed. He talked of a deed for the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,performance of which his malignant fate had reserved him, which was to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,ensue their meeting, and which was to afford disastrous testimony of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,infatuation which had led me hither.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Heaven grant that some means may suggest themselves to you of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,intercepting his approach! Yet I know not what means can be conceived.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some miraculous chance may befriend you; yet this is scarcely to be
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hoped. It is a visionary and fantastic base on which to rest our
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,security.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I cannot forget that my unfortunate temerity has created this evil. Yet
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,who could foresee this consequence of my intelligence? I imagined that
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Clithero was merely a victim of erroneous gratitude, a slave of the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,errors of his education and the prejudices of his rank; that his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,understanding was deluded by phantoms in the mask of virtue and duty,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and not, as you have strenuously maintained, utterly subverted.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I shall not escape your censure, but I shall, likewise, gain your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,compassion. I have erred, not through sinister or malignant intentions,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,but from the impulse of misguided, indeed, but powerful, benevolence.

Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,NEW YORK.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,EDGAR:--
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,After the fatigues of the day, I returned home. As I entered, my wife
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was breaking the seal of a letter; but, on seeing me, she forbore, and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,presented the letter to me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,"I saw," said she, "by the superscription of this letter, who the writer
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,was. So, agreeably to your wishes, I proceeded to open it; but you have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,come just time enough to save me the trouble."
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,This letter was from you. It contained information relative to Clithero.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,See how imminent a chance it was that saved my wife from a knowledge of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,its contents! It required all my efforts to hide my perturbation from
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her and excuse myself from showing her the letter.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I know better than you the character of Clithero, and the consequences
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of a meeting between him and my wife. You may be sure that I would exert
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,myself to prevent a meeting.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,The method for me to pursue was extremely obvious. Clithero is a madman,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,whose liberty is dangerous, and who requires to be fettered and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imprisoned as the most atrocious criminal.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I hastened to the chief-magistrate, who is my friend, and, by proper
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,representations, obtained from him authority to seize Clithero wherever
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I should meet with him, and effectually debar him from the perpetration
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of new mischiefs.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,New York does not afford a place of confinement for lunatics as suitable
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to his case as Pennsylvania. I was desirous of placing him as far as
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,possible from the place of my wife's residence. Fortunately, there was a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,packet for Philadelphia on the point of setting out on her voyage. This
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,vessel I engaged to wait a day or two, for the purpose of conveying him
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to Pennsylvania Hospital. Meanwhile, proper persons were stationed at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Powles Hook, and at the quays where the various stage-boats from Jersey
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arrive.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,These precautions were effectual. Not many hours after the receipt of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,your intelligence, this unfortunate man applied for a passage at
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Elizabethtown, was seized the moment he set his foot on shore, and was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,forthwith conveyed to the packet, which immediately set sail.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I designed that all these proceedings should be concealed from the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,women, but unfortunately neglected to take suitable measures for
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hindering the letter, which you gave me reason to expect on the ensuing
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,day, from coming into their hands. It was delivered to my wife in my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,absence, and opened immediately by her.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You know what is, at present, her personal condition. You know what
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,strong reasons I had to prevent any danger or alarm from approaching
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,her. Terror could not assume a shape more ghastly than this. The effects
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,have been what might have been easily predicted. Her own life has been
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,imminently endangered, and an untimely birth has blasted my fondest
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hope. Her infant, with whose future existence so many pleasures were
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,entwined, is dead.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I assure you, Edgar, my philosophy has not found itself lightsome and
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,active under this burden. I find it hard to forbear commenting on your
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,rashness in no very mild terms. You acted in direct opposition to my
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,counsel and to the plainest dictates of propriety. Be more circumspect
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,and more obsequious for the future.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,You knew the liberty that would be taken of opening my letters; you knew
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,of my absence from home during the greatest part of the day, and the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,likelihood, therefore, that your letters would fall into my wife's hands
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,before they came into mine. These considerations should have prompted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,you to send them under cover to Whitworth or Harvey, with directions to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,give them immediately to me.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Some of these events happened in my absence; for I determined to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,accompany the packet myself, and see the madman safely delivered to the
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,care of the hospital.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,I will not torture your sensibility by recounting the incidents of his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,arrest and detention. You will imagine that his strong but perverted
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,reason exclaimed loudly against the injustice of his treatment. It was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,easy for him to out-reason his antagonist, and nothing but force could
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,subdue his opposition. On me devolved the province of his jailer and his
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,tyrant,--a province which required a heart more steeled by spectacles of
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,suffering and the exercise of cruelty than mine had been.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,Scarcely had we passed the Narrows, when the lunatic, being suffered to
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,walk the deck, (as no apprehensions were entertained of his escape in
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,such circumstances,) threw himself overboard, with a seeming intention
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to gain the shore. The boat was immediately manned; the fugitive was
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,pursued; but, at the moment when his flight was overtaken, he forced
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,himself beneath the surface, and was seen no more.
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,With the life of this wretch, let our regrets and our forebodings
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,terminate. He has saved himself from evils for which no time would have
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,provided a remedy, from lingering for years in the noisome dungeon of a
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,hospital. Having no reason to continue my voyage, I put myself on board
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,a coasting-sloop, and regained this city in a few hours. I persuade
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,myself that my wife's indisposition will be temporary. It was impossible
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,to hide from her the death of Clithero, and its circumstances. May this
Memoirs-of-a-Sleep-Walker,1880,Huntly-Edgar,be the last arrow in the quiver of adversity! Farewell.
