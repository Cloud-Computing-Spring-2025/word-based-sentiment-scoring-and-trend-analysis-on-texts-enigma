law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Me and “Hashknife” Hartley sets there on our broncs and spells out
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the old sign, just like it was the first time we ever seen it. The
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,good Lord only knows why we’re back at the old sign. Willer Crick
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,don’t mean nothing to us. Glory Sillman lives, or did live, on
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick, but her name ain’t never figured in any of our
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,conversations since the day we fogged away from Willer Crick.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We kinda left that part of the range in a hurry that day; left a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,surprised bunch of folks watching our dust, while a couple of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,enterprising bad-men went home to get patched up and another bunch
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,throwing lead at the wrong parties, just because said parties had a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,gray and a roan horse.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,No, Willer Crick has been a closed incident to us. Not that we’re
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,silent folks, ’cause we ain’t. I can talk the bark off a greasewood,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and Hashknife Hartley—man, he’s a conversationalist. It’s kinda
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,funny that we never talked about the Willer Crick folks, ’cause they
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sure are worth talking about. Sol Vane, who does the lawin’ for the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Crick, Jim Sillman, one of the Council of Three, old Ebenezer
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Godfrey—they’re one goshawful layout.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Of course Ebenezer Godfrey is dead. Jim Albright and Pete Godfrey,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,his illegal heirs, are dead, we think, but there’s a plenty of that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,misguided tribe left. Ebenezer was killed by Pete and Jim, ’cause
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the old man wouldn’t die soon enough for one of them to get visible
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,means of support, in order to marry Glory. The old man was
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hard-boiled enough to hang on to life until he could will everything
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,he owned to me and Hashknife. Willer Crick, being a closed
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,corporation, didn’t accept me and Hashknife to any great extent.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,They stole old Godfrey’s body in order to establish what Sol Vane
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,called “corpus delectable,” but we got it back, or rather hid it
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,again. We buried some dynamite in the front yard and Sol, Pete and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Jim dug into it, thinking we had planted the old man there. Sol lost
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,all his hair and all we could find of Jim and Pete was a hat with
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the crown gone.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Me and Hashknife weathered considerable storm, but there wasn’t no
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,use in defying the lightning too much, so we got out by the skin of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,our teeth, with a Winchester rifle and a vest-pocket derringer.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Me and Hashknife cut cards to see which of us would marry Glory
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sillman, accept five hundred dollars in place of a wife and then
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,leave the country. This was to save Jim Sillman from the law of the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Crick, and would also allow Glory to go outside and get educated
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,like a human being. Willer Crick had a peculiar law. It seems that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,they rules that a girl has to stay on the crick until she gets
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,married. After she’s hooked up she can leave. Of course, they means
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to make her marry one of their own bunch, but their law don’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,specify that. It also seems that the sins of one of the family is
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,visited upon all the rest of that family.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Jim Sillman explains that everything he owns is on the crick, and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that if Glory breaks the law they’re liable to take away his
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,property as punishment. Kind of a weak way of looking at things, but
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,we can’t all think alike thataway. He offers us five hundred dollars
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,cash if one of us will marry her. This gives her the right to pull
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,her freight out of there and also saves him from their locoed law.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory don’t want a regular husband, and it’s a cinch that me and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife ain’t noways hankering for a wife, but it’s a sporting
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,chance and we takes it. We never collected that five hundred for the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,simple reason that the “uncle,” who was financing the law-breaking
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,scheme, turned out to be the sheriff of Yolo, who had been trailing
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,me and Hashknife for six months.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sometimes I’m kinda sorry we didn’t smoke up that bunch and take
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory along with us. I spoke to Hashknife about it the day we left
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,there.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Easy enough,” says he. “I could ’a’ downed her uncle and her
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,pa—easy. Any girl would whoop with joy to see her uncle and paw
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,full of lead. Maybe she’d ’a’ married you, Sleepy, dang your homely
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,face. Maybe she’d ’a’ married me—me bein’ handsome; but any old way
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,yuh take it, we’d ’a’ busted up—me and you. Yuh can’t keep a wife
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and a bunkie.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Hashknife,” says I, “would yuh rather have me than a wife?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You danged porkypine, I don’t have to support you.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,It’s been quite a while since me and Hashknife hit for the open
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,trails. We stayed at the Circle Dot a lot longer than we ever stayed
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,any one place before, but when the snow fades off the hills and the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,grass shows green on the slopes and you can smell the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sunshine—we’re traveling.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Where?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Anywhere,” says Hashknife, jingling three months’ pay. “We’re
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,follerin’ our noses, cowboy. Maybe we’ll get to Alaska this time.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I reckon that mostly all human beings have some outlook in life.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Some of ’em looks forward to the day when they can set down by the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,fire and let a hired man herd the sheep, while some looks forward to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the day when they can hunt a warm climate in the Winter and know
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that somebody is at home to do the chores.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Me and Hashknife looks forward to Alaska. What in —— we are going
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to do up there has nothing to do with it. It’s something to look
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,forward to, as the horse-thief said to the posse when they comes in
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sight of a limbless tree.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Three days after we leaves the Circle Dot, we cuts a wagon-road and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,there is that same old sign, sagging a little more and maybe a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,little more faded, but still showing:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,    THERE IS A CLICK ON WILLER CRICK
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,    THE WORST IN ALL THIS NASHUN.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,    THE HITE OF THEIR AMBISHUN
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,    IS TO BEAT THEIR OWN RELASHUN.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Still advertisin’, I see,” grins Hashknife. “Them folks sure are a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,caution to ——, Sleepy. I wonder if Sol Vane’s hair ever growed on
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,his head again. Wonder if Glory—say, Sleepy, there was a reg’lar
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,girl. ’Member how she used to fill the magazine of her rifle after
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,shootin’ once or twice? Reg’lar little he-woman. If I wanted to git
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,married——”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Which you don’t.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No-o-o, but if I did I’d—”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife squints down the road.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“By the antlers on a desert toad!” he gasps. “Here comes the joker.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Remember the old playing-cards that had a joker which was a picture
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,of a long-legged old pelican riding a little mule? The feller’s legs
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,are so long he has to spread himself to keep from dragging his feet
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,on the ground, and he’s got kind of a funny old face.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He rides up, insists on shaking hands with us and then reads the old
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sign.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I have found it,” says he proud-like.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’ve found somethin’,” agrees Hashknife. “You goin’ to visit
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Name’s Cobb, Reverend Cobb, and I am God’s pardner. Yes, I am going
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to visit the place, brother.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’m Hashknife Hartley, and I ain’t got no brother. I’ll say to you
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that Willer Crick ain’t the healthiest place on this earth, no
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,matter who your pardner is.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’ve come a long ways,” says he, “a long ways on a mule. I’ve heard
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that it’s kinda ungodly.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Ungodly!” snorts Hashknife, “lemme tell yuh somethin’ about
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that—uh—no, I won’t either. You’ve come a long ways on a mule.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Are they as bad as folks has told me?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Man,” says Hashknife, “man, there ain’t never been a liar foaled
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,yet that could do that place justice. That there sign is a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,compliment to that community.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well, I’m glad to hear the worst. _Adios_, brothers.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We watches him jog out of sight and then we pilgrims on. Some time
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,in the dim and distant past a colony of men and women and dogs and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,mules and kids pilgrimed from the South and settled in the Willer
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Crick hills. Seems that they was kinda anti-everything, and wanted
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to form a little empire of their own.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,[Illustration: Map for “Law Rustlers”]
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,They picks out this spot, took up their farms and drew sort of a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,dead-line against the rest of creation. They didn’t want
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,schools—not believing in education, and they made their own queer
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,laws. They intermarried until it took ’em a month to figure out a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,legal heir in case one of the land owners shuffled off. A few of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,’em, called the Council of Three, assisted by Sol Vane, who does the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,lawin’ for the Crick, had enough education to see that the rest of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the colony didn’t get anything that the council and one didn’t want
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,’em to get. Glory explained the system to us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“My ——!” snorts Hashknife. “I could shoot once and kill your
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,uncle, a cousin, a half-brother, a brother-in-law and a nephew.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Which wasn’t true in Glory’s case, being as her dad had busted the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,law by marrying outside the colony.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,This close relationship has bred a fine bunch of chinless
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,horse-thieves, gun-men and hard drinkers. Seems like the men with
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the least chins always carries the most guns. There had never been a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Cricker arrested for anything else. Willer Crick dealt with
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,’em in their own way, and kept its mouth shut, except when it came
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to lying about their own innocence.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Me and Hashknife rides along for a while and then Hashknife pulls up
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,his horse and looks back. I looks back too, but there ain’t nothing
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to see except the hills.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sleepy,” says Hashknife, kinda like he was thinking, “what do yuh
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,reckon they’ll do to the Reverend Cobb up there?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well, if Gospel was something they could steal, I’d say they’d
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,entertain him over night.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That’s what I was thinkin’, Sleepy. In the words of the immortal
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,George Washington: turn, boys, turn, we’re goin’ back.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“George never said that,” says I. “It was Bryan.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“All right, all right; have it your own way. What I don’t know about
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,geography would make a set of hymn books, but I know somebody said
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,it.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Why go back, Hashknife? Willer Crick wouldn’t hurt a preacher.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Not while he’s preachin’; but he can’t sermonize all the time.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick needs reformin’, Sleepy, but it’s got to be done in a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,language they understand.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“It’s a fool idea,” I argues, “Willer Crick ain’t forgot us. They
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,may be ignorant, but their memory ain’t weak. They may be shy on
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,literature and art, Hashknife, but they sure as —— can shoot, and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,they’ll just about put the kibosh on us ever getting to Alaska.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You sure do get morbid, Sleepy. If Willer Crick had brains I’d pass
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,’em by. They can’t think beyond next drink-time.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“If they recognize us they’ll think like this: there’s them two
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,crazy cowpunchers who depleted our community. Wonder who they’ll
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,smoke up this time? That’s the way they’ll think.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“And then start to shoot in self-defense. A preacher don’t mean
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,nothin’ to me, Hashknife. What do you want to foller him in there
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,for?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I dunno, Sleepy. I ain’t been to church since Sittin’ Bull first
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sat down, but there’s somethin’ kinda helpless about a preacher—and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick is so —— ornery.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Was your folks religious?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I don’t reckon they was. Paw and maw split up when I was knee-high
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to a tall Injun, and paw took me with him. Paw thought he was a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,two-gun man and I becomes a orphing at a tender age.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You helpin’ out folks thataway is goin’ to stop me and you from
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ever seeing Alaska, Hashknife.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He turns in his saddle and smiles at me. Hashknife ain’t no
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,beautiful critter. He’s one of them hard-eyed, thin nosed and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,thin-lipped _hombres_. His cheek-bones are kinda high and his ears
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,kinda bat out and his hair is roan. He’ll fight at the drop of the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hat; fight with a foolish grin on his face, and he ain’t afraid.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,That’s why I like Hashknife. I’m kinda scary, myself, and I need
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,moral support as I trail through life. When Hashknife smiles, every
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,dog within half a mile begins to wag its tail. Hashknife calls me
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and him, “cowpunchers of disaster.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He turns and smiles at me.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sleepy, I see by the almanac that she’s goin’ to be awful cold in
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Alaska this Winter. Mebbe we better pick out one of their warm
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Winters.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I think,” says I, kinda mean-like, “I think you’re going into
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick to see somebody—and she ain’t no preacher.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No-o-o, Sleepy. ’Course I’d like to see her and apologize for not
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,marryin’ her that time. Girl kinda expects a apology in a case like
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that. Mebbe her uncle told her why, but he’d sure paint us black so
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that she’d be glad I left her at the altar.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Them Willer Crick hills sure do look natural. We rides past the old
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Godfrey ranch, which me and Hashknife owned for a few days. The old
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ranch-house is still squeegeed from the force of the dynamite, when
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the “heirs apparently,” as Sol Vane called ’em, dug into the alleged
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,grave of poor old Godfrey. It looks like nobody had ever lived in it
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,since we left.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We rides on past the Sillman ranch, where Hashknife came danged near
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,being a bridegroom and a cash-widower. We don’t see anybody around
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,there, but Willer Crick is a great place for folks to not be in
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,evidence. About a mile farther on we comes to the town.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,It sure is some town. There’s a saloon, a store and a blacksmith
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,shop on one side of the street and on the other side is an old shed,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,a long tie-rack and a pile of old lumber. The saloon is two-stories
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,high, and the upper half has a sign which proclaims it to be the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Town Hall.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,There’s several saddle horses tied to the rack. The town hall has an
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,outside stairway and around the bottom of this is grouped four men.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,When we get off our broncs one of the men strolls over to us. It’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Al Bassett. Al was one of those who was very active in seeking our
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,demise when we were in Willer Crick before, but me and Hashknife
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,never figured him much of anything but a talker. He squints at us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Howdy, Bassett,” grins Hashknife. “Remember us?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well,” says Bassett, drawing a deep breath, “well, ye-e-s, I do.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He stares at us like he was kinda wondering why we came back there
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,again. His mouth kinda gaps as he stares.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Better look out or you’ll get your tonsils sunburned,” says
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Them other three fellers moves over closer to us. We never seen them
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,before. Bassett turns and starts to speak to ’em, but just then we
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hears loud voices, and out of the the door of the store backs a man.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,In one hand he’s got a six-gun and in the other is a package. He
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,turns his head away from the open door and just then comes the thump
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,of a pistol-shot. The feller kinda jerks around, drops his gun and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,package and falls against the side of the building, where he slides
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to the sidewalk.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He ain’t no more than went flat when out of the store come a man,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,bareheaded and in his shirt sleeves, with a gun in his hand. He
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,stoops over, picks up the package and then looks down at the man.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Bassett steps in past us and says:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“What was the matter, Cale?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well—” the man licks his lips and then wipes the back of his hand
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,across his mouth—“well, I tol’ him I wasn’t ’lowed to sell him
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,nothin’. He gits kinda uppity and drags his gun. Then he he’ps
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,himself to a bottle of medicine, flings the money on the counter and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,backs out. Yuh notice he didn’t git away with it, don’t yuh?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Bassett nods and turns the man over. He’s been drilled dead-center.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The storekeeper is staring at me and Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Mind tellin’ why yuh killed him?” asks Hashknife soft-like. “Where
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I came from, buyin’ medicine is a necessity—not a killin’ matter.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“None o’ yore—” begins the feller, but Bassett stops him.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Hol’ on, Cale. Lemme tell him.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I can run my own——”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You shut up!” snaps Bassett. “This feller askin’ questions is the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,feller who inherited the Godfrey ranch that time. This other feller
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,is his pardner.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The storekeeper stares at us, and kinda grumbles to himself, but
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,goes back inside. Them other three hombres gawps at us considerable
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,but don’t say nothing.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Bassett leads us to the end of the little board sidewalk, and we all
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sets down.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“What are you fellers doin’ here?” asks Bassett.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Waitin’ for you to think up a lie to tell us about that killin’,”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,says Hashknife. “Yuh might as well tell us the truth. Who was the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,feller what got hit?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Eph Sillman.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Jim Sillman’s son?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Uh-huh—Glory’s brother. He done busted all our laws. Yuh see, he
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,married an outlander about seven year ago.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’re doin’ most of the talkin,” reminds Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Eph brought that woman here, but nobody’s ever had anything’ to do
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,with her. They got a kid about seven year old. On ’count of Jim
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sillman we had suffered ’em to live here and trade the same as the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rest of us, but not havin’ much truck with him and his. He gets
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,drunk the other day and he talks too much. The council takes action
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,on him and decides to outlaw him. They says he can’t buy nor sell
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,here. He knowed he couldn’t buy that medicine, but he was
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hard-headed.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“His woman couldn’t associate with other women?” asks Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Nope. Yuh see, she’s a ——”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“His little kid can’t play with other kids?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No. The other——”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Kinda tough, don’t yuh think, Bassett?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“When a feller makes his bed he’s got to lay on it.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife nods and looks at his toes.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Bassett, did yuh ever read the Bible?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Nope.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Yuh ought to, Bassett. It tells yuh how to pray.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Pray?” says Bassett, kinda queer-like. “Whatcha mean?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You could learn some prayers,” says Hashknife soft-like, “and then
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,yuh could teach ’em to the rest of the Crick, ’cause they’re goin’
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to need ’em—bad. Who will tell his widder about this?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“The council, I reckon. Jim Sillman, Sim Sellers and Black
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Albright.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Goin’ to be a nice chore for Jim Sillman—tell her that his own son
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,is dead. Didn’t Glory have nothing’ to do with Eph’s wife?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Glory—I dunno,” says Bassett, scratching his head. “Some says she
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,has. There’s been several quarrels about it in the last year. She
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,has been watched close, but nothin’ comes of it, except that ‘Tug’
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Williams got a rifle bullet into his shoulder one night.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Where does Eph Sillman live?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Bassett points down the road.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“About two mile down there. Second ranch to the left. House sets
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,back in the cottonwoods. You ain’t goin’ down there.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’ve been misinformed,” says Hashknife. “We’re goin’ down there,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I reckon.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Better keep away, Hartley. Willer Crick ain’t askin’ yore help. My
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,advice to you would be——”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Ignored,” finishes Hashknife. “Absolutely, Bassett. You ought to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,know us better than to give us advice. You ain’t forgot how we acts,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,has yuh?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Willer Crick remember you two.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“If anybody cares,” grins Hashknife. “Come on, Sleepy.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We swung back on to our broncs and points off down the road. Bassett
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,joins them other three fellers and they watches us ride away.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Outside of the body on the sidewalk, Willer Crick is just the same
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,as when we rode in.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I hope to see buzzards circlin’ that place,” says Hashknife. “I’d
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,like to be called upon to say a prayer over the whole works.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“What would you say?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’d say, ‘The rest of you ordinary sinners stand back, ’cause
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,there’s goin’ to be one awful fire in ——.’”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We found the place, and tied to the front gate is the Reverend
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Cobb’s mule.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Whatcha know about that?” grunts Hashknife. “Leave it to a preacher
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to smell out things like this.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We walks around to the back door. Standing in the doorway is Glory
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sillman. She’s kinda leaning against the side of the door, looking
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,away from us. Then she turns.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Howdy,” says Hashknife, taking off his hat. “Nice day.” Glory kinda
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,jerks back when she first sees us, but after the first look she
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,kinda takes a deep breath and stares at us. I reckon she thought we
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,was Willer Crickers at first.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Then she says kinda soft—
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You two!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Yes’m,” says I. “Same old two of us ma’am.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Just then a little kid comes out beside Glory. He’s a little,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,round-eyed shaver, and he’s been crying dirty tears or has been
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,crying tears on a dirty face, ’cause he sure is streaked.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That’s his kid,” says Hashknife, kinda whispering.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Whose kid?” asks Glory, but before Hashknife can answer her the old
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,man comes out.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He brushes his hand across his eyes and stares at us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Yuh beat us up here, grampaw,” smiles Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Yes,” says he. “I—I reckon I did.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Then he puts his hand on Glory’s arm and says to her:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Girl, I want to thank yuh for your kindness to her. She tol’ me
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,some of it. Yuh see, she never wrote to me and I never knew how
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,things was. I decided to come, yuh see.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’re welcome,” says Glory thoughtful-like.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Seven year and a few months,” says the old man, like he was talking
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to himself. “Me wonderin’ why she don’t write, and—and it’s a long
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ways to Arizony—on a mule.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Woman sick?” asks Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Not now,” says Glory sad-like. “Maybe she’s better off, I don’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,know. Anything is better than livin’ here like she had to live.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Where’s her husband?” asks Hashknife, like he didn’t know.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Gone to town,” says Glory. “He—he was going to try and get some
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,medicine.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Ain’t yuh got no doctor?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Yes, but——”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He wouldn’t come?” asks Hashknife, and Glory shakes her head.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“She was my daughter,” says the old man, and then he says to Glory,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Will yuh come in with me and he’p me a little?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The little kid looks at us and then follers them inside. Me and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife looks at each other. We’re kinda hard-boiled, but it’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,getting under our hides a little.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Then we hears voices out by the gate, and here comes a lot of men.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We figures it’s the council coming to notify Eph’s wife. It ain’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,right to feel thataway, but I’m kinda glad she wasn’t able to hear
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,what they has to say. Hashknife touches me and I steps around the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,corner with him.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,This gang trails around to the back door and we hears one of ’em
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,speak to Glory. The old man must ’a’ come to the door, ’cause we
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hears somebody ask Glory who the old man is. The old man starts to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,talk, but one of the gang says:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“We jist wants to say that Eph got killed today.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We hears Glory say:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Eph Sillman?” kinda strained-like.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Uh-huh.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Dad, is this true?” asks Glory, but we don’t hear Jim Sillman
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,answer.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“What or who killed him?” asks Glory.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Nobody seems to know,” says a voice. “He’s layin’ up there in front
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,of the store. Bassett heard the shot and so did several more folks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Bassett says that two fellers rode through town today, and he’s dead
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,certain that they’re them same two cowboys what tried to steal the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Godfrey place. Them two is likely the ones what done it.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“They better not show up around this country,” states a voice. “I’m
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,lookin’ fer them two, y’betcha.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife pinches me on the arm.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That’s one of the fellers what tried to hold me up for the five
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hundred dollars I never got. I reckon I shot high.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Eph went to see if he could get a little medicine,” says Glory, and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,her voice is high pitched. Then she adds, “But it wouldn’t ’a’ done
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,any good.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Did—did she die?” asks Jim Sillman.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“She was my daughter,” says the old man. “My daughter.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“This here e-state will need considerin’,” says a voice.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“My gosh, there’s Sol Vane!” gasps Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“How about the kid?” asks some one.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He don’t count,” declares another. “He’s the brat of a outlander.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Mebbe we better look around fer them two gun-fighters.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’m lookin’ fer ’em, y’betcha,” states the feller who has promised
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to dance our hair. “All I needs is one look.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife steps away from the side of the building and around the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,corner, with me on his heels. The folks are grouped in kind of a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,half-circle around the doorway. Glory and the old man are on the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,steps, with the kid between ’em. On the left side of the doorway is
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Jim Sillman. Standing at the rear of the half-circle, looking like a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,turkey gobbler in a flock of turkeys, stands Sol Vane, craning his
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,long, dirty neck and chewing a mouthful of tobacco that stretches
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,his face all out of shape. They turns and looks at us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Yuh might use up that one look right now,” says Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The bunch kinda sway away from each other. One cinch, there’s never
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,any chance for pot-shooting on Willer Crick. I sees Sol Vane swaller
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,real hard and the bulge is gone from his skinny cheeks. The rest of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the bunch just seem to stare at us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife has got his eyes on that big-talker, who is just about in
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the center of the crowd. He’s sort of round-shouldered, fish-eyed
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and looks like he ain’t been curried for a year. His eyes are flat,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,if you know what I mean. They’re like the eyes they put in mounted
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,animals. He’s got a big gun hanging on his hip, but he ain’t made a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,move toward it yet.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You, I’m talkin’ to,” says Hashknife. “You dirty centipede. Set
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,your eyes on me, feller. I’m the hombre you spoke about. Reach for
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,your gun, you cross between a polecat and buzzard. Make good, can’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,yuh?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I never seen Hashknife like that before. This is once that he ain’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,laughing. Maybe he knows that one shot will spill the whole works,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and the odds are all against us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The feller licks his lips but don’t speak. His face looks kinda
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,funny—like he was scared to breathe. Hashknife walks up to him,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,slow, but this feller don’t move. The rest of the crowd seems
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hypnotized, but I wasn’t taking no chances. I sets the butt of my
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,.45 against my hip and waits for the break to come.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife takes this feller’s gun out of its holster and tries to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,make him take it in his hand, but all this feller does is look like
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,a dog that has been caught doing wrong. Hashknife takes the feller’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,belt off, takes him by the shoulder and turns him around.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Go home,” says Hashknife kinda hoarse-like. “Go home and be glad
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,you’re alive.” I never seen anything like it. That feller walked
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,away, kinda slouching, and Hashknife turned back to face the bunch.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,It was Hashknife’s face and eyes that froze that bad _hombre_. He
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,was hypnotized, but the minute Hashknife turned his back this feller
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,came to. He swung sideways, grabbed his vest and flashed another
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,gun.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I was looking for just that. He was about fifty feet from me, but I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,took a chance and shot twice.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Man, I was just in time. His bullet cut the dirt at Hashknife’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,feet. He looks down at his pistol and then kinda tosses it away from
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,him, like he was all through with it, and then turned as though he
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,was going away—but he didn’t. I glances at the bunch and then at
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife, who was facing them with a gun in his hand.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Hashknife,” says I, “you do take the worst chances. These Willer
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Crick rattlers has more than one set of fangs. Little more and that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Alaska trip would ’a’ been all off.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’re the little snake-hunter, Sleepy,” he grins. “Much obliged.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Then he faces the bunch and they’re sure one uneasy crowd. Me
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,downin’ that feller don’t mean nothin’ to them—much. Hashknife
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,glances from face to face, and finally looks straight at Sillman.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Eph Sillman was your son, wasn’t he?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sillman don’t speak: just shifts his feet.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That dead woman in there was your daughter-in-law, Sillman. You
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,folks denied her a doctor and then yuh killed her husband when he
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,was man enough to try and get medicine for her. We seen that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,killin’. Bassett and three other men saw it; now yuh tried to throw
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the deadwood on me and Stevens.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You fellers try your dangdest to stir up trouble, don’t yuh?” wails
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sol Vane. “I didn’t think you’d ever come back here, I didn’t.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I came back to see if your hair growed out, Sol,” says Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“If yuh want another hair cut, I’ll bury the dynamite.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Nobody had a word to say, but finally Sol Vane spoke—“The feller
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,you gunned up over there is Lem Sellers. He’s a brother to Sim
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sellers.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I don’t care if he’s his own uncle and brother-in-law,” says
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife. “Who is Sim Sellers?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Head of the council,” says Sol, like he’d sprung something on us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sim’s the head man of Willer Crick.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I hope he’s got more guts than Lem,” says Hashknife. “I like to do
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,my own killin’.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Just then that little kid kinda sneaks up beside Hashknife and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife looks down at him. The little feller looks up at Hashknife
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,with them big eyes, and then he just slips in closer, like a pup
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,does when he likes yuh.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Come here, Buddy,” says Glory, but Buddy’s hanging on to a rosette
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,on Hashknife’s chaps and don’t even look at her.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Buddy kinda inherits this ranch, don’t he?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That’s a question,” says Sol Vane. “A question for the council to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,decide.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“And they’ve already decided,” says Glory.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife looks down at Buddy and then at the bunch of men.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“The kid’s goin’ to get a square deal, ain’t he, Sillman? He’s your
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,grandson.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The men all looked at Sillman, but Sillman don’t speak.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Your grandpaw’s goin’ to see that you gets a square deal, Buddy,”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,says Hashknife, patting the kid on the head.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,One of the men kinda snickers and then turns away.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Who’s goin’ to keep the kid now?” I asks. “His family ain’t in no
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,shape to take care of him.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sol Vane clears his throat. The son-of-a-gun looks like a gobbler
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,with something stuck in his neck.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well that’s a question. He ain’t a Sillman and he ain’t nothin’
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,else—much. It’s a question, I reckon. Nobody on the Crick is
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,beholdin’ to his folks that I knows on.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sol Vane swallers hard and begins to chaw again.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He’s your kid, Sillman,” says Hashknife soft-like.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’d like to—” begins Glory, but Sillman stops her.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Then he says to Hashknife:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Hartley, you ain’t got no business hornin’ in like this. Willer
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Crick can handle its own affairs, and Willer Crick will decide what
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,is to become of the kid.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“And you’re his gran’paw,” says Hashknife, “gran’paw to a nice
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,little harmless kid like this. And you say that Willer Crick will
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,tend to him. Why—” Hashknife teeters on his toes and hooks his
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,thumb over the belt above his gun—“why, you herd of mangy curs! You
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,pack of gutter pups! Go ahead, you chinless maverick—reach for your
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,gun! No? Then listen to me, you lousy cowards! You, Sillman! I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,thought you was an inch or two above this carrion, but you ain’t.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,You’re all alike. You’ve married your own relations until your
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,brains are warped and shrunk so badly that you ain’t above eatin’
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,your own kind. The cannibal will protect its own blood, but you
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,coyotes won’t.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Them Willer Crickers never made a false move. Maybe they’d ’a’
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,nailed us, bein’ about five to one and all armed, but we’d ’a’ sure
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,give the buzzards a feed, and them men knowed we would.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I wish,” says Hashknife, “I wish I had education enough to tell
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,folks what I think of yuh. There’s a lot of words I don’t know, dang
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the luck.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The old man steps down from the doorway and moves in beside
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Brother,” says he, “you’ve done well. If I can help yuh out in any
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,way, I’d be plumb willin’. I’m a preacher of the gospel, but there
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,is times when a good cuss word does come in handy.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Are yuh through?” asks Sillman meek-like.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No, I ain’t!” snaps Hashknife. “I’ve got to think of somethin’ new
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to call yuh. Ain’t there nothin’ I can say that will make yuh mad?
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Ain’t yuh got enough decency left to accept a insult?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Mebbe,” says Sol Vane, “mebbe you’ll find out—later.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Thanks,” says Hashknife dry-like. “I’m glad to have somethin’ to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,look forward to. I had a open, runnin’ shot at you once, Sol, and I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,was fool enough to shoot low. Next time I’m goin’ to cut you off
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,above the collar.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You cain’t threaten me, Hartley!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I ain’t threatenin’ yuh. No, you buzzard, I’m statin’ a fact.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“There’s fifty men on Willer Crick,” states another one of the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,bunch.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Pass the word,” says Hashknife. “There’s just that much difference
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,between us and you. Me and Sleepy are square shooters and we’d love
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to have yuh come and bring all your friends. Only twenty-five
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,apiece. Sleepy, there don’t seem to be much chance for us to get
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,action here.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Who’s goin’ to take the kid?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I am,” says Hashknife. “He’s too good to live with Willer
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Crickers.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He, he, he,” cackles Sol Vane. “He, he, he.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sol Vane, you’re goin’ to choke to death some day,” states
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife. “Right in the middle of one of them laughs you’re goin’
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to quit seein’ the funny side of serious things. Now, you
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,snake-hunters, pick up that would-be assassin and drift. I don’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,want him clutterin’ up the scenery. Tell your friends that we’re
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,receivin’ company at any time.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,They files past us and picks up Lem Seller. I don’t reckon Lem’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,plumb dead, but he ain’t in no shape to help himself much. They
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,loads him up and drifts, while me and Hashknife and the little kid
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,stands there and watches ’em go.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory is inside the house. After they drifts out of sight I steps up
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to the door and peers inside. I see Glory standing by the front
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,window. Then she turns and leans a Winchester rifle against the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,wall. Hashknife looks over my shoulder and sees her place the gun,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and then he looks at me kinda queer-like.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory wasn’t takin’ no chances on Willer Crick smoking us up. The
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,little kid hangs on to Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I like you,” says the little jigger, looking up at Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well, for gosh sakes!” gasps Hashknife. “Whatcha know about that.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Buddy, me and you are goin’ to bunk together for quite a spell.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You play wit’ me?” he asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well, my gosh!” says Hashknife foolish-like. “Well, whatcha know
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,about that?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Brother,” says the old man, “was you serious about takin’ Buddy?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’re a preacher,” says Hashknife, “and I admire preachers a heap,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,but just you try takin’ him away from me. Ain’t nobody sayin’ I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,can’t take him, is there?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory looks at Hashknife and then down at the kid.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’m glad for Buddy,” says she.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Buddy glad,” says the kid.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well, my gosh!” gasps Hashknife. “Don’t this beat —— and high
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,water?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick never made no foolish breaks when we went up with Eph
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sillman’s old wagon and team and brought Eph’s body back with us. Me
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and Hashknife went up there and took it—that’s all. They’d moved
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,him off behind the sidewalk and put a old blanket over him. The
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,store was closed and there wasn’t man, woman nor child in sight.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory said they wouldn’t bury him, and I reckon she was right. Me
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and Hashknife dug two graves and Hashknife built two boxes. It’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,awful to have to plant folks thataway, but we done our dangdest to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,make it look right.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The old man kind a broke down over the sermon, which was natural,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and Hashknife finished it up. Glory was there. It was her brother,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and I reckon she thought a lot of him. Buddy didn’t know what it
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,meant, but he bawled anyway, which made a real pleasant party all
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the way around. I reckon the old man was kinda loco over it all,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,’cause he went out, got on his mule and pulled his freight.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory didn’t have much to say after it was over. She kissed the kid,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and then got on her horse.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I ain’t had much chance to talk to you two,” says she, “but I want
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,you both to know I’m obliged to you. Maybe they won’t let me see you
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,again, but I hope you’ll take Buddy and get away—which I know you
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,won’t do.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Glory Sillman,” says Hashknife, “you’re welcome—and we won’t.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,She smiled at us and rode away, and we stood there with our hats in
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,our hands, like a pair of fools until she’s out of sight.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well,” says I, “we’ve met Willer Crick.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Not all, Sleepy; there’s forty more, so they say. Glory left her
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rifle. It’s standin’ in there, and hangin’ to it is a belt plumb
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,full of shells. She likely didn’t know we had a pair of rifles.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“She did,” says I, “but she wanted to have an extra one here when
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,she showed up.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We cooks supper, but neither of us has any appetite. Buddy wants to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,get on Hashknife’s knee all the time, and Hashknife ain’t got no
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,conversation in his system, except, “My gosh!” They’ve got the house
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,fixed up kinda nice inside. There ain’t much furniture, but it’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,clean, which is something in Willer Crick.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Don’t yuh never have no little boys to play with?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Li’l boys?” says Buddy, “I’m li’l boy.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“This country ain’t human, Sleepy,” says Hashknife. “This here
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,family must ’a’ been ignored complete, the same of which would drive
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,anybody loco. Honest, I thought Jim Sillman was half-human, but he
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ain’t. Glory’s a humdinger, but she’s sure handicapped. Think of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,these _hombres_ spyin’ on her to see if she ever comes to see her
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sister-in-law. Ain’t they the meanest, sneakinest bunch of pariah
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,dogs yuh ever seen? It ain’t hard to see who slammed that bullet
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,into Tug Wilson. Too bad she shot high.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I’m leaning against one of the front windows, looking down the road,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and I sees a man coming. It’s almost dark, but I _sabe_ that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,pelican.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Here comes Sol Vane,” says I.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He rides up to the front gate, gets off his horse, takes out a white
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rag. I opens the front door.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Can yuh see me?” he asks, waving the rag.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Come ahead,” I yells back at him, and he shuffles up to the door.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I packed a flag,” says he, masticating real fast and looking at
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife with the kid on his lap, “I ain’t got no gun on me.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Yuh didn’t need to deprive yourself of a gun,” says Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I ain’t comin’ to talk mean,” explains Sol. “We held a council
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,uptown, and I just comes down here to let yuh know some of the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,things we argued out.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Some was in favor of bustin’ down here and puttin’ yuh on the run,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,but I’m plumb in favor of goin’ kinda soft.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sol grins and takes a fresh chew.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“They wasn’t hard to convince that your way was the best, was they?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I does the lawin’ fer Willer Crick, and they accepts my
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,judgment—mostly. I comes to talk to yuh about th’ brat.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Boy, yuh mean,” says Hashknife. “In speakin’ of this offspring,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sol, use the boy’s name or just speak of him as ‘the boy.’”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The little jigger knows that Hashknife is sticking up for him, I can
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,see that, and he kinda leans back against Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“This here ranch,” says Sol, “belongs to—well, I reckon it’s a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,question. Jim Sillman owns part of it and the rest of it’s to be
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,settled by the council.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Meanin’ that Buddy gets gipped out of his ranch, eh?” asks
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Under the circumstances, the br—Buddy don’t own nothin’. His folks
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,was just suffered to kinda live here.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Suffered,” nods Hashknife. “Go ahead.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I reckon that’s all.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“All for you,” amends Hashknife, “but I ain’t started yet. For one
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,thing, Sol Vane, I’m goin’ to do this: I’m goin’ to the county seat,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,find a regular lawyer and make Willer Crick jump over the moon. I’m
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,goin’ to see that this here baby gets a square deal and I’m goin’
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to——”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Now, now,” grunts Sol Vane. “Don’t git excited. Willer Crick ain’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,goin’ to beat nobody out of nothin’—not if they owns anythin’,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,y’understand.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“This here Buddy is exhibit A,” says Hashknife. “Willer Crick took
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,away his folks but they don’t take away nothin’ more. This ranch
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ain’t much, but it’ll be somethin’ for him to live on.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife gets up and steps over beside Sol Vane.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You tell your —— council that Buddy owns this ranch, will yuh?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“’Pears to me,” says Sol, “that you’re kinda anxious to—the kid
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,bein’ a minor and you grabbin’ him thataway, it kinda looks like you
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,was sort of——”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sol Vane made one awful mistake when he hinted that Hashknife was
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,trying to feather his own nest. I seen Hashknife swing his body
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sideways, and Sol Vane landed flat on his face on the little dirt
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,walk. It was a beautiful smash. We stands there and watches him
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,twitch back to life, like one of them animated toy things. He
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,managed to get to his feet and start for the gate, but ran into a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,tree and fell down again.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Then he got up and found his horse, but he didn’t take time to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,mount; just went staggering down the road, leading the horse.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Good!” says Buddy, and his eyes were like saucers. “Sol Vane bad
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,mans, my daddy says.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“My gosh!” gasps Hashknife. “Did yuh hear that? He said it was good.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,This feller ain’t no Willer Cricker, y’betcha.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Not bein’ wishful to take any chances of a night attack, the three
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,of us slept in the open. We took bedding from the house and rolled
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,up under the trees. Buddy thought it was a picnic. The next morning
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,we finds a notice on the front door, which reads:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,    GIT OUT THIS IS THE LAST WARNIN
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well,” observes Hashknife, “we’ll just about take that advice. Not
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that Willer Crick is runnin’ any whizzer on us, Sleepy, but we’ve
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,got to kinda look out for this little Buddy, eh, Bud?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Betcha,” nods Buddy. “But we ain’t scared, are we?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“It’s a wonder to me that this here kid ain’t cleaned up on that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,bunch before this, Sleepy. He’s got plenty of nerve. Did yuh ever
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,shoot a gun, Buddy?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No, but I betcha I could.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He’s got it, Sleepy,” grins Hashknife. “Natcheral born terrier.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Let’s pack up.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We saddled our broncs and packed up all the clothes we can for the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,kid, which ain’t much. We took a little grub and then pulled out,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,with the kid riding in front of Hashknife. We took Glory’s rifle and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,belt with us, figuring on going past Sillman’s place and leaving it
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,there.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,There’s another road angling off the one to town, and the kid tells
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,us that it goes past Glory’s place. We ain’t got nothin’ to take us
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,through town; so we swings off onto this road. About a mile farther
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,on Hashknife pulls up his horse and squints off down into a brushy
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,coulee.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sleepy, there’s the old’ man’s mule there, ain’t it?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“It’s the mule all right; feeding around in the brush.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We swings our horses around and rides along the edge of the coulee,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,which leads down a deeper ravine.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Anybody live around here—close, Buddy?” asks Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Mitch Ames lives down there,” says Buddy, pointing down the ravine.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Fine!” grins Hashknife. “I dunno Mitch, but we’ll go down and see
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,him.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You seen him yesterday,” says Buddy. “He was to my house with them
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,men.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Oh, is that a fact? Well, he called on us, Buddy, and it ain’t no
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,more than fair that we calls on him. Sleepy, did yuh notice that the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,mule was wearin’ a piece of pocket-rope. Likely broke loose.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Mitch Ames’ cabin was cached away in that ravine, like he was scared
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,somebody would find it, but Buddy knowed right where it was. We
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,swung down the hill above it. Setting beside the cabin, tilted back
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,in a chair, is two men. One of the horses steps on a round rock and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sends it bumping down the hill and it hops into the bushes right
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,near ’em.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Jump? Man I’d say they jumped! One of ’em had a rifle across his
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,knee, and when he seen us he started to throw it to his shoulder,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,but the other feller grabbed him and yanked him around the corner.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Me and Hashknife drops out of our saddles and slips our rifles
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,loose. We didn’t come there hunting for trouble, but if it showed up
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,we’d be ready.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Buddy, you get down in the brush,” orders Hashknife, pointing to a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,thick clump. “You get down low and wait for us.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Betcha,” says Buddy. “Me wait.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The little jigger dives down into the brush like a rabbit and then
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,me and Hashknife separates a few feet apart and slips down to the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,cabin—or rather toward the cabin, ’cause just about the time we hit
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the flat ground a hunk of lead whispers so close to my head that I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,heard what it said. We flops down and waits awhile.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The brush is kinda thick and we can only see one side of the cabin.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We lay there quite a while, but there ain’t no more shots. We kinda
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,snakes along until we works up beside the cabin, where we listens
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,for a while, but can’t hear a thing. Hashknife gets to his feet,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,takes out his six-shooter for close work and walks to the door end
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,of the cabin, with me on his heels. The door is shut. Hashknife
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,gives it a kick and it swings open. Inside it is dark, being as
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,there’s only one window, and that dirty.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We steps inside, and looks around, and as soon as our eyes gets used
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to the dusk we sees that there’s a man laying on the bed.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,It’s the old preacher that rode the mule, and he’s sure hog-tied to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,a fare-thee-well, and has a rag shoved between his teeth.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife takes out his knife and starts to cut the ropes, but stops
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and listens. Then he jumps for the door, with me behind him.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“The horses!” gasps Hashknife. “I heard them rollin’ rocks. There
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,they go!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Up over the peak of a hogback goes our two horses, with a man in
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,each saddle, and one of ’em is packing Buddy. Hashknife throws up
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,his .45-70 Winchester.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Buddy’s on that bay!” I yelps. “Look out, Hashknife!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The rifle cracked and the gray horse swung sideways as the bullet
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,fanned past its ear and the rider throws himself kinda sideways.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,It’s only a jump more to get out of sight and the range is about two
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hundred yards. I glances at Hashknife just as he shoots again.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I seen the rider of the gray horse slump sideways and go down on the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,left side of the gray. I reckon he must ’a’ tangled in the reins,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,’cause it swung the gray plumb around on the hogback and it stops
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,with its head down.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We went up there as fast as we could, but the bay horse and its two
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,riders were out in the breaks. That bay horse could outrun anything
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,in the cow-country, even packing weight; so we know it ain’t going
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to do us any good to try and run him down with that hammer-headed
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,gray.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,This feller has got one foot twisted in the stirrup and has the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,reins twisted around his hand and elbow. That big bullet had lifted
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,part of his scalp and the top of his right ear, but he wasn’t dead.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Worst shootin’ I’ve done in a age,” complains Hashknife. “Kinda had
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,buck-fever, I reckon. Shame to waste two shots thataway.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We hung the feller over the saddle and went back down to the cabin,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,where we cut the old man loose. It took him quite a while to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,recognize us and also to get his vocal cords to working again.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“How did yuh happen to be in this shape, old-timer?” asks Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He shakes his head.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I don’t know, brother. I went to the town, after I left you, and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I—I asked a man where I could find the sheriff. He wanted to know
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,what I wanted him for and I said I wanted to talk to him on
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,business. I left there, and in a few minutes some men overtook me
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and brought me here. They tied me up and left two men to guard me.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,One of the men told me that if I ever seen the sheriff it would be
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,after the sheriff had died and joined me.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We led the old man outside and showed him the wounded man.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He’s the one what told me that,” says he. “What happened to him?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He stayed too long,” grins Hashknife. “We’ll tie him up in your
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,place.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,This hombre has commenced to talk to himself, so we ties him to the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,bunk, where he won’t get loose for a while.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You take the horse and round up the mule, Sleepy,” says Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,That wasn’t no job, being as the mule had sore feet. I took it back
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to the cabin and turned it over to the old man. Me and Hashknife
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,doubles up on the bay horse and the three of us cut back to the main
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,road again.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,About a mile or so farther on we comes to the Sillman ranch.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife points down the road and says to the old man:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Keep on this road, pardner, until yuh come to the sign where we
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,first met yuh, then yuh turn to the left. Silverton is about twenty
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,miles.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I wants to thank yuh, son,” says he. “Wants to thank both of yuh
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,for what yuh done fer me. I’m gettin’ kinda old and so
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,forth—but——”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“A man ain’t no older than he feels,” says I.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Then I’m a million. Got rheumatics and them ropes didn’t he’p it
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,none. _Adios._”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Now,” says Hashknife, “I hope he gets out free of charge, ’cause I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ain’t got no more time to monkey with him.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We swung into Sillman’s gate and rode up to the house. I reckon
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory seen us ride into the place, ’cause she comes out the front
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,door to meet us and the first thing she says is—
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Where’s Buddy?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,It don’t take Hashknife long to tell her what happened to Buddy and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,how we found the old preacher.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Where’s your pa?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“In town, I reckon. Council meeting called, I think. They met here
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,last night, but I didn’t get any chance to hear what was said.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,They’re all suspicious of me. Sim Sellers wants me to be punished
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,for assisting Eph’s wife, and him and dad had a run-in over it. Sim
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,growled at me when they came and I told him that Lem was a growler
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and look what he got.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sim ain’t no better than a savage, and he said he’d eat your heart
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,out if he got a chance. I told him he better get some extra teeth
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,’cause he might lose what he’s got. I thought that dad would give me
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,—— for sayin’ it, but he didn’t. He asked me where I left my
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rifle, and I told him I left it in a good cause.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Glory,” says Hashknife, “do yuh know why I didn’t marry yuh that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,time?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No, I—I don’t,” says Glory, turning red, “but it wouldn’t ’a’
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,worked any way, ’cause Willer Crick showed up in force. Me and Dad
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and uncle Luke thought you seen ’em coming.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Your Uncle Luke was the sheriff of Yolo, wasn’t he, Glory?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He was once—yes.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“When he was here?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No-o-o—not hardly. He got in bad with the Vigilantes down there.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife looked at me and I looks at him, but neither of us says a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,word. Then Glory says:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“What do you reckon they’ll do with poor Buddy? What did they steal
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,him for? Nobody wanted the little feller.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“They want to get him away from me so there won’t be no heir to that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ranch,” says Hashknife. “They’re goin’ to hoodie that poor little
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,kid out of the way, Glory.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife eases himself in his saddle and looks off across the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hills. “I never had nothin’ like him—nothin’ in my life. The little
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,jigger liked me, and kinda depended on me, I reckon. I said I was
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,goin’ to keep him, didn’t I?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife turns and looks at us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I said that, didn’t I? Well, that goes as she lays. Somebody on
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick has got Buddy, and I’m goin’ to start in at the foot
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and work my way up, and I’m goin’ to git that kid if I have to fill
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,—— with Willer Crickers.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory nods like she knowed Hashknife meant it.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Loan me a horse and saddle?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No,” says Glory, “I won’t loan you a horse, but there’s several out
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,in the corral and there’s a couple of saddles hanging in the shed. I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,can’t stop you from taking what you want, can I?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Me and Hashknife starts for the corral.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That roan out there can run all day,” yells Glory. “He don’t look
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,it, but he’s the best bronc in this country.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I hate to take things like this by force,” says Hashknife
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,serious-like. “It ain’t right to intimidate a lady thataway.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’re a pair of brutes,” says Glory. “Pick on somebody your own
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,size.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I don’t know whether Glory was kidding about that bronc or not. It
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,bucked over the corral fence with me, bucked for half a mile faster
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,than Hashknife’s animal could run. After that it was a pretty good
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,animal. We headed straight for town.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Willer Crick will be looking for us, Hashknife,” says I.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I hope so, Sleepy. I hopes they forms a holler square and hauls out
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,their cannon.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Mebbe,” says I, “mebbe we ought to let Willer Crick dispose of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,their own business. They ain’t got no sense, but maybe they’ll give
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the kid a square deal, if we give ’em a chance.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Maybe the devil could skate—if he had ice—but we know he ain’t.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,There’s at least twenty-five saddled horses in town, but not a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,person in sight as we swung down the street, but as we swung past
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the store a man came out. He gave us one look and then started for
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the outside stairs of the town hall. He showed speed, but not
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,enough. Hashknife jumped his bronc across the sidewalk and into that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,feller, just short of the bottom step.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The bronc’s shoulder hit that feller, and he went spinning away like
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,a tumble-weed in a wind; then Hashknife’s bronc hit the flimsy
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,railing of the stairs and went down. Out of the tangle comes
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife and he’s got his Winchester. The bronc gets to its feet
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and limps away, while Hashknife runs along the side of the building
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and around to the front.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Get off and under cover, you danged fool!” he yelps at me. “Willer
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Crick is all upstairs!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I jumps my horse out of line with the windows and gets off. I hears
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,somebody yelp a question, and then I follers Hashknife across the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,street, where we ducks in behind that old shed. I reckon that Willer
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Crick was too excited to take a shot at us when we went across the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,street.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Extending out from the side of the shed is a pile of old lumber,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,which we proceeds to get behind. It’s about three feet high and ten
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,feet long. Between us and the other side of the street is the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,tie-rack, full of saddle-horses.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The feller who got knocked down is crawling out of sight behind the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,saloon, and Hashknife’s bronc is just wandering around between the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,saloon and the store.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“There’s our bay horse,” says I, pointing at the tie-rack.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Then a bullet dusted the top of the lumber pile and sent some
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,splinters into my face.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Keep low,” advises Hashknife. “They’re a-shooting from the windows.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We’ve got to be careful that we don’t hit Buddy.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Then Willer Crick starts in to make a lead mine out of our lumber
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,pile, but them old boards sure do stop bullets. One feller gets
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,cocky and looks out of the door. I lifts his hat and I think a part
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,of his scalp, cause he yelps like a bee had stung him.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Don’t shoot until you’re sure,” grins Hashknife. “We can’t take any
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,chances of hittin’ our little jigger.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Think a lot of that kid, don’t yuh,” says I.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“’Thout a doubt in the world, Sleepy.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“It ain’t noways reasonable for you to adopt him,” says I.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife recovers his hat, with a hole in the crown, and nudges in
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,closer to the lumber pile, while Willer Crick sifted lead across the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,street.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Nobody wants him but me, Sleepy, and I ain’t goin’ to let the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,little jigger go to no orphing home, y’betcha. Maybe I ain’t no
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,fittin’ person to bring up a kid, but—oh, oh-h-h!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife slips his rifle-barrel into a slot between two boards and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,then twists over almost on his shoulder, in order to look down the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sights. A feller has slipped out of the doorway, thinking that we
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,didn’t dare to expose ourselves enough to shoot.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife’s rifle cracked, and the feller’s feet slipped and he sat
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,down hard. I don’t know where it hit him, but it made him either
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,brave or sick, ’cause he just sets there, until a arm sticks out of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the door and hauls him back inside. Then the shooting seemed to ease
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,up.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“What do you fellers want?” yells a voice.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“This is a —— of a time to ask questions!” yells Hashknife. “Don’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,stop shootin’ on our account.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Just then a bullet nicked a piece of meat off the point of my jaw,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and splatted into the wood beside my head. Before we can move,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,another bullet hit Hashknife’s hat.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Behind us!” I yelps. “Look out!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife flips off his hat and yanks his gun out of the slot.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Look out yourself! That son-of-a-gun I knocked down has circled
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,us.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick woke up to the fact that something is wrong, and they
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sure hammered our fort.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Zowie! A bullet spinged off my rifle-barrel and almost knocked it
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,out of my hands.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Watch the hall,” says I. “I’ll tend to our neighbor before he
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,spoils our Alaska trip for good.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I crawls in behind the old shed. Behind us is nothing but mesquite
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,brush, which don’t make very good cover, especially for the first
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,fifty yards.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick is still trying to annihilate that pile of lumber, so I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,takes a chance and crawls like a snake. None of ’em seen me and I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,reached the heavy brush in safety. I hears this feller shoot again,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and all to once I see him. He ain’t over fifty feet from me. There’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,kind of a high piece of ground, with some rocks on it and a lot of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,mesquite clumps.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He’s having quite a nice time all by his lonesome and ain’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,expecting visitors. He has to lift up real high to send his lead
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,anywhere near Hashknife. He’s shooting one of them old 1876 models
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,of Winchester, the kind we calls “grasshopper” action.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He rises up on his toes, squints down the sights, but seems to kinda
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,get dissatisfied and relaxes. I could almost throw my gun and hit
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,him, and shooting him thataway would be murder; so I waits until he
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,lines up his sights again and then I slams a bullet into the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,loading-gate of his rifle.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I reckon a .45-70 hits kinda hard, cause it knocked him loose from
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that gun and he sat down hard. Some of the busted mechanism must ’a’
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,dented the primer of one of the shells in the magazine, ’cause that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rifle sure raised —— for a few seconds. The owner of the gun
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,wagged his head and looks down at the barrel of my rifle, which was
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,poking into his belt.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Get up!” says I.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He got up kinda slow-like, shaking his head and then he grabbed for
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,his six-gun. I’m too close to him to shoot with the rifle, so I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,uppercuts him under the chin with the barrel, and he lost interest
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,in everything.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I took his belt and six-gun back with me. Willer Crick seen me as I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,came back, but they must ’a’ hurried their aim. I got back to the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,shed, with my eyes, ears and nose full of dirt and a hole in my
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sleeve. Hashknife is doubled up, covering the doorway from that slot
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,in the lumber pile.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’re a fine friend,” says I. “You let ’em all come to the window
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and shoot at me.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“They had Buddy with ’em, Sleepy. Dang it, I was afraid to shoot.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Somebody yells at Hashknife, but I don’t hear what he said.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No yuh don’t,” answers Hashknife. “You let us have Buddy and we’ll
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,call it square.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife motions for me to stay behind the shed. I seen him settle
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,down and line up his rifle again. He lifts his head and says:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sleepy, for ——’s sake, look! He’s usin’ Buddy for a shield. The
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rotten coward!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I jumps to the corner of the building and looks. There’s a big
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,feller coming down the stairs, with Buddy held in front of him. He’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,got his arms wrapped around the kid, and there ain’t a chance in the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,world for us to shoot him.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Take that bay hoss, Sim,” yells a voice from the hall. “He can
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,outrun anythin’ around here.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He, he, he!” cackles Sol Vane. “He, he, he!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife empties his rifle through the windows of the hall and Sol
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,quit laughing.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Yuh can’t git the best of Sim Sellers,” whoops a voice.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sim comes on to the horses, which are plumb nervous. One of ’em
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ripped its bridle loose and went down the street and another threw
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,itself, trying to get loose. Sellers is kinda between us and the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,windows, which stops their shooting.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Don’t get scared, Buddy,” says Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I ain’t,” shrills Buddy. “Betcha I ain’t.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sim,” says Hashknife, “you better think up a prayer, ’cause you’re
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,goin’ to need one —— bad.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sellers cursed us and carried  Buddy in close to that bay horse,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,which has anchored itself with its left side against the tie-rack
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and refuses to budge. It’s easy enough to use a kid for a shield
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,against bullets, but it’s another thing to get on to a scared bronc
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,with the kid in your arms and still keep covered.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick are liable to hit Sellers if they shoot at us, so we
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,takes things easy.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’re in a hole, Sim,” says Hashknife. “One bad move and you’re a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,goner.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’ll have to get on Injun side,” says I, “and that bronc will
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sure love you for that.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sim Sellers sure is up against it. I reckon he seen what he was up
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,against—seen that he had to take a chance; so he threw Buddy into
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the saddle, intending, I reckon, to throw himself sideways on that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,bronc and make a getaway like an Injun, but Hashknife was looking
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,for that move.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,As Buddy went into the saddle it left Sim’s legs exposed under the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,bronc’s belly. Hashknife shot twice with his six-shooter and Sim
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,went down, like something had cut his legs out from under him. The
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,horse plunged against the rack, throwing Buddy between us and the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hitch-rack, but he lit on his hands and knees.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Come a-runnin’, Buddy!” yells Hashknife, and if you ever seen a
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rabbit, that kid sure imitated one.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He dived around the corner of that lumber pile and landed between
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,us, where he sets and puffs the wind back into his lungs.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Hurt yuh any?” asks Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Na-a-a-w! Sim Sellers like to busted my ribs, though. Did yuh kill
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,him?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Cut him loose from the ground,” says Hashknife, watching the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,windows.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Set still, Sim. Don’t forget that both ends of yuh are exposed
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,now.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sim Sellers is setting there in the dust, with a pair of legs that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,don’t seem to work.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“They stole me,” says Buddy. “After you left me with the horses,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Mitch Ames and ‘Poky’ Vane swiped me. I kicked Mitch in the knee and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,he swore he’d kill me. He brought me here. Say, they’re goin’ to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,kill you—honest. They ain’t goin’ to let you tell the sheriff on
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Cale Ames. They sent men to get the old man.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Where were they goin’ to take you, Buddy?” asks Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Me dunno,” Buddy shakes his head. “Sim Sellers says he’s takin’ me
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,where you fellers never will find me.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Hey!” yells a voice from the hall, which we recognizes as belonging
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,to Sol Vane. “Can yuh hear me?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“If yuh don’t yell too loud,” answers Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Now listen; that shed beside you is containin’ about five hundred
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,pounds of dinnamite, caps and fuses. Come out and hold up your hands
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,or we’ll shoot into it until we blows yuh up. Do yuh hear that?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Me and Hashknife looks at each other. It’s a good bluff. I don’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,care a whoop who says nay, I’m here to state that dynamite might go
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,off under them conditions. Some of them hombres are shooting .50-110
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rifles, which carries a explosive bullet, and that might make things
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,plumb audible around us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Talk to ’em, Sleepy,” grunts Hashknife. “Keep talking, for ——’s
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sake!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You mean, you’d blow us up, Sol?” I asks, as Hashknife slides past
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,me and gets against the building.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“He, he, he! Think we’d let ye off after what you’ve done? Naw, sir,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,your goin’ to git all that’s comin’ to yuh. When I give the word we
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,start shootin’.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Of course they never thought that we had a chance to sneak away into
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the mesquite, and if they did they knew we’d never leave on foot as
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,long as there’s a chance to get horses.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“We’re willin’ to go now,” says I. Hashknife rips one of the boards
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,loose and crawls inside.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Ready to go, are yuh?” chuckles Sol Vane. “Jist try startin’, will
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,yuh. There’s twenty rifles ready to give yuh a sendoff.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Think I ought to put Sim Sellers out of his misery?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sim Sellers quits crawling and looks back at me. He thought we had
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,forgot him.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Throw away your gun!” I yells at him, and he threw it away.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well, what have yuh got to say?” yells Sol Vane.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Give me a chance to think it over.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Two minutes,” says Sol. “Two minutes will be all.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That’s enough,” grunts Hashknife, forcing his way out past the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,loose board.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He’s got a fifty-pound box of dynamite in his arms, a box of
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,blasting caps and a coil of fuse.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Whatcha goin’ to do?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Give ’em a taste of their own medicine, Sleepy. When I get around
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the corner here start shooting. Empty your rifle and then empty
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,mine. _Sabe?_ Fan them windows to a fare-thee-well, and I’ll do the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rest. Buddy, keep down low. Ready?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I takes both rifles, nods to him and starts throwing lead. I sure
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,did send hot hunks of sudden death into that place. I emptied both
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,rifles and then sent six shots from the .45 I borrowed out in the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,mesquite.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Two or three shots was all that answered, but they never came
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,towards me.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Good work, Sleepy,” yells Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I slammed shells into the loading-gates of them two rifles and then
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,took a look. Hashknife is flat up against the front of that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,building, and is fussing with a fuse.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I hears a bunch of argument in the hall, and I takes a snap-shot at
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,somebody who got too close at the window.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Keep ’em back, Sleepy,” yells Hashknife, cheerful-like, reeling out
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,fuse from the box of dynamite.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sol Vane!” he yells.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That’s me,” squeaks Sol.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’ve got fifty pounds of dynamite against the front of your
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,building, Sol. There’s a two-minute fuse on a loaded stick, and the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,box of powder is settin’ on a box of primers. I can either fire the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,fuse or shoot the primers. If you fire a shot toward that shed I’ll
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,upset Willer Crick. Do you _sabe_?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,There ain’t a word said for a while, and then Sol says—
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You—what do yuh want us to do?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I want you to bring down every gun up there, Sol. Load up and bring
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,’em all down here and lay ’em in the street.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Like —— he will!” roars a voice.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’ll never get my guns!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Nor mine!” howls another.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Better do it,” advises Sellers. “He’s got just what he says he
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,has.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’m countin’ to ten,” states Hashknife. “Countin’ in my own rapid
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,way, Sol.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’m comin’,” says Sol. “For gosh sakes give me a little time.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sol Vane looked like a hardware store when he made that first trip.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I never seen so many guns outside the army. He lays ’em in the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,street and then goes back for more. It took him four trips to bring
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,’em.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Now what?” he whines.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Have ’em all come down, one at a time,” says Hashknife, and then he
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,yells over at me: “Watch ’em, Sleepy. If they look like they’re
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,holdin’ out on us, don’t give ’em a chance.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’m particular,” I yells back. “Send ’em down, Mr. Lawyer.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Then they begins to file out and down the stairs. Sol lines ’em up
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,in the street, and they sure are a sore crowd. Finally they quit
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,coming.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Is that all?” asks Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That’s all of ’em,” says Sol.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I starts to get up, but Buddy grabs me by the belt and yanks so hard
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that we both went over backwards. With his heels in the air, Buddy
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,yelps—
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Mitch Ames and Cale Ames ain’t out yet!”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,That’s all that saved us, I reckon. I rolled over, shoved my rifle
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,across the lumber pile and took a snap-shot at Cale Ames, as he
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,threw down on Hashknife from one of the windows. I seen Cale’s gun
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,fall outside and he fell down past the window-sill. Hashknife jumps
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,back around the corner and covers the crowd with his six-shooter.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I reckon that Mitch Ames figured that Hashknife would explode that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,dynamite, and he also figured that we wouldn’t let him surrender; so
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,he ran out of the door, and vaulted over the top of the railing. I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ain’t no wing shot with a rifle, but Mitch Ames didn’t get up after
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,he hit the ground.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Got him!” I yells at Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Buddy follers me out into the street and we meets Hashknife near the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,crowd.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sol,” says Hashknife, “I ought to kill you for lyin’. If it hadn’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,been for Buddy your scheme would ’a’ worked. I reckon them Ameses
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,are your best shots, eh?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sol masticates real fast for a while, and then says—
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“What do yuh want now?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Watch ’em, Sleepy,” grins Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife takes a sheet of paper and a pencil from his pocket and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,holds the paper against the side of the building, while he writes.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,He finally finishes and goes over to Sol Vane and hands him the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,paper.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Have your council sign that, Sol; and then you put your name at the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,bottom.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“What is it?” asks Sillman.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“To whom it may concern,” reads Sol Vane kinda slow-like. “The
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,undersigned hereby declares that Buddy Sillman is sole owner of the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ranch where his folks lived and he owns everything on that ranch.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,His dad’s name was Eph Sillman and he was killed by Cale Ames on
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,June 3, when Eph was trying to get medicine for his sick wife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“We also admits that the folks of Willer Crick wouldn’t let Eph
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Sillman have a doctor for his wife and that they ain’t no better
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,than murderers, ’cause she died. We hereby agree to see that the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,ranch is run right and the money turned over to Buddy. We hereby
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,agree to abolish all our old laws and live like the rest of the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,world. We hereby sign our names.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You’re crazy!” wails Sim Sellers from where he sets in the street.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“We’ll never sign that.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The rest of ’em shake their heads.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Yuh can’t get away with nothin’ like that,” says Sol. “We aims to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,live as we please. Yuh can’t set there and keep us rounded up
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,forever.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sleepy,” says Hashknife, “go up into the hall and see if yuh can’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,find some Willer Crick records.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,                *       *       *       *       *
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,They has that room fixed up like a court-room, with kind of a place
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,for the judges and all that kind of thing. Cale Ames is setting on
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the floor near a window, holding onto the side of his head. I looked
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,him over for weapons, but he’s harmless.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,On the judge’s desk is a pile of books and papers. I takes a look at
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the biggest book, and it’s labeled—
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,    THE LAW
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I takes all the books and papers, and then I makes Cale get to his
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,feet and go down ahead of me. Our bullets sure have carved our
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,trade-marks in their furniture and walls. Willer Crick wails when
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,they see me with their books.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Good stuff!” grunts Hashknife. “Now, maybe they’ll sign my little
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,paper.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I never seen folks so anxious to sign anything. Hashknife held the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,paper on the brim of his hat so that Sim Sellers can sign. I unloads
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,all them guns and then throws the whole works under the sidewalk,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,where nobody can get one quick.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Rope the books together so we can carry ’em, Sleepy,” says
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Them is our records!” wails Sol.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“That’s why we need ’em,” grins Hashknife. “You and your council are
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the only ones what can read and write, and I’m thinkin’ that your
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,law and records will make hy-iu readin’ for the county attorney.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Willer Crick is stuck. They shuffles their feet and swallers hard.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Your home-made law is a thing of the past,” observes Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’ll send the sheriff in here after Cale Ames, and mebbe Cale won’t
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,be the only one he rounds up.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I got the horses, while Hashknife holds the crowd. Hashknife takes
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Buddy with him, while I take the law of Willer Crick. We starts
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,away, with the crowd watching us, but all to once they makes a dive
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,across the street toward the hitch-rack. I thinks they’re going to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,try to foller us, but it comes to me in a flash that I seen two or
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,three rifles hanging to those saddles.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I seen a feller drop flat and slide under the sidewalk, and I know
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,it won’t take ’em long to get their guns loaded.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We ain’t over a hundred yards from the crowd, and I can see that we
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,can’t scatter ’em much with two guns. I yells at Hashknife to look
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,out. He turned in his saddle, keeping himself between Buddy and the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,crowd. I saw him throw up his rifle and take deliberate aim. I was
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,trying to shift them books on to the horn of my saddle, so I could
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,shoot. A bullet splatted into the books, but before I could lift my
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,gun, Hashknife’s shot was echoed by a crash that shook up the whole
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,country.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I seen the front of that building jump off the ground and dissolve
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,into smoke.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Come on, you law rustler!” yelps Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I ducked a piece of two-by-four and set my spurs into that
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hammer-headed gray. Hashknife had been lucky enough to send a bullet
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,into that box of giant caps under the fifty pounds of dynamite.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I looks back as we hammers down the road, but there ain’t a soul on
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,our trail. We swings across a high bridge over Willer Crick, and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife stops.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Get a couple of heavy rocks, Sleepy,” says he. “Rope one on each
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,side of that bunch of books, and drop the whole works over the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,side.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Ain’t yuh going to turn these over to the law?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“No-o-o, I reckon not. I don’t believe in rubbin’ anybody raw.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,They’ll never know but what we did, and we’ve sure amended the
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,constitution of Sol Vane and his bunch.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We sunk their law in six feet of swift water and then rode on. About
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,half a mile from the forks of the road we swings around a curve and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,almost runs over Al Bassett and another man. Bassett’s right arm is
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,out of commission and the other feller is kinda sick from too much
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,lead.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“They were sent after that old man,” says Buddy.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“It’s been a hard day for Willer Crick,” observes Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Bassett can’t hang onto himself any longer. Hashknife takes off his
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,hat and holds it in his hand until Bassett stops.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Sleepy,” says Hashknife, “did yuh ever hear the like. I wish I
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,could cuss like that. Bassett, you’re one of the fellers who was
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,sent down here to stop the old man, ain’t yuh? Did the mule kick yuh
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,or did the old man bite yuh?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Bassett refuses to talk, and the other feller is too sick to
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,remember.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“A feller by the name of Poky Vane is tied up in Mitch Ames’ cabin,”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,says Hashknife. “I reckon you’ll see that he gets loose.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Willer Crick will git you yet!” snarls Bassett.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I refuse to argue,” grins Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Home won’t never seem the same to you fellers. _Adios._”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We left ’em there in the road.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Why didn’t we take Cale Ames out with us, Hashknife?” I asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Mebbe the sheriff won’t be able to find him.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“It would be our word against a hundred, Sleepy. Me and you ain’t so
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,danged lily-white that a jury’d take our word against a hundred; and
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,besides, hangin’ ain’t half as bad as thinkin’ about it.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,At the forks of the road, where the old sign-board hangs, we found
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the old preacher and Glory Sillman with a rifle.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I had a escort,” says the old man, nodding at Glory. “She—she saw
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,that I got out safe.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“She did,” nods Hashknife. “I seen that a mile or so ago.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory starts to swing her horse around.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I—I reckon I better be going back,” says she.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You come wit’ us,” says Buddy. “We licked ’em.” Glory looks at
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Buddy and then at Hashknife.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I’m goin’ to adopt him,” says Hashknife. “Yuh might come with us,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory. There ain’t no more Willer Crick law to stop yuh now. The
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,trail’s wide open.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Glory and Hashknife sets there and looks at each other. I looks at
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,the old man and he looks at me. I turns and points down the valley
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,and says to the old man:
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Do yuh see that peak ’way down there, old-timer?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I do. What about it, son?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I never climbed it in my life.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Well, well!” says he. “Ain’t that queer?”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,We sets there like a pair of danged fools and admires that peak,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,which don’t mean a thing to either of us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“You comin’?” shrills Buddy, and we turns to see Hashknife and Glory
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,riding down the road side by side, while Buddy leans out past
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,Hashknife and yells at us.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,The old man looks at me and says—
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Son, if you’ll ride slow, mebbe I can make my mule keep up.”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,I turns in my saddle, grabs that old sign and tears it off the tree,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,after which I throws it into the brush. Then I turns back to the old
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,man.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“I ain’t in no hurry, ’cause I know I’ll never get there anyway,”
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,says I.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Where?” he asks.
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,
law-rustlers,1921,tuttle-w-c,“Alaska.”
